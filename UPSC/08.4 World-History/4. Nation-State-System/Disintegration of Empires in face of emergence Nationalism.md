1. "Under **Mustafa Kemal's dictatorship**; Turkey was rapidly nationalized." Comment. [1986, 20 Marks]
- < https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/kemal-ataturk>

```ad-Answer

Mustafa Kemal, also known as Ataturk, was the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey. He came to power in the 1920s and implemented a series of far-reaching reforms aimed at modernizing and nationalizing Turkey.

Some of the steps he took to nationalize Turkey included:

-   Abolishing the Ottoman Caliphate and secularizing the state: He abolished the Ottoman Caliphate, which had been the religious and political center of the Ottoman Empire, and replaced it with a secular government. This helped to separate religion from politics and gave the state more control over religious institutions.
    
-   Changing the legal code and educational system: He introduced a new legal code based on European models, which helped to modernize the legal system and promote individual rights. He also reformed the education system, introducing a more secular curriculum and making education more widely available.
    
-   Promoting Turkish nationalism: Kemal promoted Turkish nationalism and tried to create a sense of national identity among the Turkish people. He encouraged the use of the Turkish language, and replaced the Arabic script with a new Turkish alphabet.
    
-   Promoting Economic Development: Kemal implemented policies of Economic development, promoting industrialization and modernization of Turkey, which helped Turkey to become a more self-sufficient and less dependent on foreign powers.
    

The impact of these nationalization policies was significant. They helped to modernize Turkey, create a sense of national identity among the Turkish people, and promote economic development. The policies also helped to reduce the influence of foreign powers and increase the power of the state. However, it's worth noting that the nationalization process and policies were implemented under authoritarian regime, there were restrictions on freedom of speech, press, and political opposition, and human rights were not always respected.

1. "Nominally the new Turkey was republican and democratic." Comment. [1992, 20 Marks]
- <https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/kemal-ataturk>

```ad-Answer

The statement "nominally the new Turkey was republican and democratic" suggests that while on paper, Turkey was officially a republic and a democracy, in practice, it was not fully democratic.

Mustafa Kemal and his Nationalist Movement came to power in the 1920s after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and established the Republic of Turkey. The new government officially adopted a republic and democratic system, with a separation of powers, an elected parliament and a president as the head of state. However, Kemal's regime was authoritarian, and he held a significant amount of power. The new government suppressed political opposition and dissent, and Kemal himself held the title of "President" and "Commander-in-Chief" with sweeping executive powers.

Furthermore, Kemal's regime was characterized by one-party rule, with his own party, the Republican People's Party, being the only legal party in the country. Civil liberties and freedoms were restricted, and the press and media were heavily censored, which prevented the emergence of alternative political groups.

1. Turkish renaissance guided by Kemal Pasha revolutionized the Turkish life at many levels. Amplify. [1996, 60 Marks]
- <https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/kemal-ataturk>

```ad-Answer

The Turkish renaissance, also known as the Kemalist revolution, was a period of social, political, and cultural transformation in Turkey during the early 20th century. It was led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who later became known as Kemal Pasha. The goal of the renaissance was to modernize and secularize Turkish society, and to create a new national identity for the country.

The renaissance brought about many changes in Turkish life. One of the most significant was the adoption of a new alphabet, which replaced the Arabic script with a modified version of the Latin alphabet. This made it easier for people to read and write, and helped to promote literacy and education.

Other major changes included the adoption of a new legal system and the implementation of land reform. The new legal system was based on the Swiss and German models, and was designed to protect individual rights and to promote democracy. Land reform helped to break up large estates and distributed the land to small farmers, which helped to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for many people.

In addition to these changes, the renaissance also brought about a shift in the role of women in society. Women were given the right to vote and to hold public office, and education was made available to girls and women, which helped to empower them and give them more opportunities.

1. "The Eastern Question has always been international question". Elucidate. [2010, 30 Marks]
- < https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095739581>

```ad-Answer

The Eastern Question refers to the political and diplomatic problems caused by the weakening and eventual collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman Empire was a vast multiethnic and multireligious state that had long been a major player in the politics of Europe and the Middle East. As the empire began to decline, various European powers began to compete for influence and control over its territories, which led to a number of conflicts and crises.

The Eastern Question arose several times throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of the most notable examples include:

-   The Crimean War (1853-1856), in which Russia, France, and Britain fought against the Ottoman Empire over control of the Black Sea region.
-   The Congress of Berlin (1878), in which European powers redrew the map of the Balkans and established new boundaries for the Ottoman Empire, which led to a number of ethnic and nationalist conflicts.
-   The Balkan Wars (1912-1913), in which several Balkan states declared independence from the Ottoman Empire, which led to further conflict and tensions in the region.
-   World War I (1914-1918), in which the Ottoman Empire entered on the side of the Central Powers and fought against the Allies, which led to the collapse of the empire and the emergence of new nation-states in the Middle East.

The Eastern Question was always an international question because it involved the interests and interventions of multiple European powers in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. European powers had different interests and priorities and this led to several conflicts and crises. The question also had a major impact on the politics and diplomacy of the region and Europe, and it continues to have an effect on the current Middle East politics.
