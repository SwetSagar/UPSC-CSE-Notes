1. Account for the emergence of the national monarchies in Europe in the sixteenth century. Did the monarchs build the national states less by design than by chance? [1987, 60 Marks]

```ad-Answer

The emergence of national monarchies in Europe in the sixteenth century can be attributed to a combination of factors including:

1.  The decline of feudalism: The feudal system, which had been the dominant form of political organization in Europe for centuries, was in decline in the sixteenth century. As a result, monarchs were able to assert more control over their territories and centralize power.
    
2.  The rise of the middle class: The growth of trade and commerce led to the rise of a middle class with economic power, which supported the centralization of power in the hands of monarchs.
    
3.  The growth of the nation-state: The emergence of the nation-state as a concept in the sixteenth century led to the development of a sense of national identity, which supported the centralization of power in the hands of a single ruler.
    
4.  The influence of the Renaissance: The ideas of the Renaissance, such as the emphasis on the individual and the importance of centralized authority, helped to strengthen the position of monarchs in Europe.
    
5.  The role of War and Military: The monarchies of Europe were also strengthened by the growing importance of military power in the sixteenth century. Monarchs were able to expand their territories through warfare and gain greater control over their subjects by using their military power.
    
6.  The Reformation and Counter Reformation: The split of Christianity during the Reformation also helped to strengthen monarchs in Europe. Monarchs were able to use their religious authority to gain control over their subjects and to consolidate power.
    
7.  Political and economic factors: The monarchies were also strengthened by the rise of absolutism, which allowed monarchs to centralize power and make decisions without the consent of the nobility. Additionally, the monarchies had the economic resources to finance their armies and bureaucracies, which helped to solidify their power.

Formation of Nation states was by chance : 

1.  It is argued that the monarchs did not necessarily build the national states by design, but rather by chance. They may have been responding to changing political and economic conditions, rather than actively seeking to create a centralized state.
    
2.  The emergence of the nation-state as a concept in the sixteenth century, and the sense of national identity that came with it, may have been a more significant factor in the development of national monarchies than the actions of individual rulers.
    
3.  The monarchs were also influenced by the ideas of the Renaissance, which emphasized the importance of centralized authority, which reinforced their position.
    
4.  The need to expand territories through war and military power also played a role in the emergence of national monarchies.
    
5.  The role of economic factors, such as the rise of the middle class, and the ability of monarchs to finance their armies and bureaucracies also played a role in the emergence of national monarchies.
    
6.  The role of the Reformation and Counter Reformation also played a role in the emergence of national monarchies, as monarchs were able to use their religious authority to gain control over their subjects.
    
7.  However, it's important to note that this is a debated topic among Historians, and some have different views.
    
Historians such as J.H. Elliott, in his book "The Revolt of the Catalans" argues that the centralization of monarchies was not a natural process, but a deliberate effort by the monarchs to assert their authority and eliminate regional autonomy. Similarly, historian David Parker in his book "National Identity and Political Thought in Germany: Wilhelmine Depictions of the French Third Republic, 1890-1914" suggests that the emergence of the nation-state was the result of a conscious effort by the ruling elite to create a sense of national identity and to use it to mobilize the population and consolidate their power.

On the other hand, historian Ernst H. Kantorowicz in his book "The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology" argue that the emergence of national monarchies was a gradual and complex process, shaped by a variety of economic, social, and political factors rather than the conscious efforts of rulers. Similarly, historian William Beik in his book "Absolutism and Society in Seventeenth-Century France: State Power and Provincial Aristocracy in Languedoc" suggests that the emergence of the national state was a product of the changing economic and social conditions rather than the deliberate actions of rulers.
