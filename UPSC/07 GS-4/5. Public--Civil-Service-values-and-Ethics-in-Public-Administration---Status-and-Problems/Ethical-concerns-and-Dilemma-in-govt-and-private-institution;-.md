Good governance refers to a system of governance in which all stakeholders are able to participate in decision-making processes, with the aim of promoting the common good. Good governance is characterized by a number of key elements, including transparency, accountability, participation, responsiveness, rule of law, and the protection of human rights.

Recent initiatives in e-governance have helped to enhance the quality of governance by increasing transparency, reducing corruption, improving access to information and services, and streamlining administrative processes. For example, the introduction of electronic voting systems and the debate on Remote EVMs has made the electoral process more transparent and secure, while e-government portals have made it easier for citizens to access information about government policies and programs, as well as to apply for government services. Initatives such as Diglocker, Darpan Portal, MyGov intitiatives are a step towards the right direction.

One of the most significant recent e-governance initiatives has been the implementation of the Indian government's Digital India program. This program aims to transform the country into a digitally empowered society, where all citizens have access to digital services and the benefits of digital technology. This program has had a positive impact on the lives of many citizens, especially in rural areas, by increasing access to education, healthcare, and financial services. For example, the initiative of providing a unique identification number (Aadhar) to all citizens has improved access to social welfare schemes, while the introduction of digital technologies in the health sector has improved the delivery of healthcare services to remote and rural areas.

However, it must be noted that e-governance initiatives are not a panacea for all the problems of governance. They require a supportive environment, including a strong legal framework, to be successful. Additionally, e-governance initiatives must be inclusive and accessible to all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status. The technology used in these initiatives must also be user-friendly and accessible to people who are not familiar with digital technologies.

In conclusion, e-governance initiatives have the potential to improve governance by enhancing transparency, accountability, and access to information and services. However, it is important to ensure that these initiatives are well-designed, implemented and supported, in order to realize their full potential and ensure that they benefit all citizens, including those in remote and rural areas.

1. (b) Online methodology is being used for day-to-day meetings, institutional approvals in the administration and for teaching and learning in education sector to the extent telemedicine in the health sector is getting popular with the approvals of the competent authority. No doubt, it has advantages and disadvantages for both the beneficiaries and the system at large.

The use of online method has increased significantly in various sectors of society, including administration, education, and health. The widespread adoption of online method has many advantages, such as convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. However, it also presents various ethical issues that need to be considered, especially with regards to the vulnerable section of society. In this context, the following are some of the ethical issues involved in the use of online method:

1.  Privacy and Security: Online methods use digital technology and therefore, the privacy and security of sensitive information are at risk of being compromised. This is particularly problematic for the vulnerable section of society, such as individuals with disabilities, the elderly, and children, who may be more susceptible to cyber attacks and fraud.
    
2.  Digital Divide: The online method may exacerbate the existing digital divide between those who have access to technology and those who do not. This digital divide may result in unequal access to online services, thereby perpetuating existing inequalities in society.
    
3.  Quality of Service: Online methods may result in a decline in the quality of services provided to the vulnerable section of society. For example, telemedicine may not provide the same level of care and attention as face-to-face interactions with medical professionals.
    
4.  Bias and Discrimination: Online methods may perpetuate bias and discrimination, particularly with regards to the vulnerable section of society. For instance, the use of algorithms in decision-making processes may be influenced by existing biases in the data, leading to discriminatory outcomes.
    
5.  Inadequate Regulation: The use of online methods is often not adequately regulated, leading to a lack of accountability and protection for the vulnerable section of society. This is particularly problematic in the case of telemedicine, where the quality of care may be compromised due to the lack of regulatory oversight.

To ensure that the use of online methods is ethical, it is crucial to have robust privacy and security measures in place, to bridge the digital divide, to maintain the quality of services provided, to address bias and discrimination, and to regulate online methods adequately.

2. Impact of digital technology as a reliable source of input for rational decision making is a debatable issue. Critically evaluate with a suitable example.

```ad-Answer

Digital technology has been a game-changer in the world of information and communication. With the advent of computers, the internet, and mobile phones, the amount of data generated and processed has grown exponentially. Digital technology provides a vast amount of information at our fingertips, which has made it possible for individuals and organizations to make informed decisions in real-time. However, the impact of digital technology as a reliable source of input for rational decision-making is a debatable issue.

On one hand, digital technology has revolutionized the way data is collected and analyzed. The ease of access to a large volume of data and the ability to process it in real-time has enabled organizations to make better decisions. For example, the retail industry uses digital technology to analyze consumer data and make decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and pricing. Another example is the healthcare industry, where digital technology has enabled medical professionals to access and analyze patient data, making diagnoses and treatment decisions more accurate.

On the other hand, the accuracy of the information available through digital technology is questionable. The vast amount of data available online can be unreliable, and not all sources are trustworthy. Misinformation and fake news can spread quickly on social media, making it challenging to separate fact from fiction. The ease of access to digital technology has also made it easier for individuals to manipulate information to suit their purposes, further reducing the reliability of digital information.

Moreover, digital technology can be subject to hacking and cyber attacks, which can compromise the security of sensitive information. In some cases, organizations and individuals can be vulnerable to cyber attacks that result in the loss or manipulation of data, making it unreliable for decision-making.

4. Distinguish between laws and rules. Discuss the role of ethics in formulating them. (विधि और नियम के बीच विभेदन कीजिए । इनके सूत्रीकरण में नीति-शास्त्र की भूमिका का विवेचन कीजिए।) 2020

```ad-Answer

Laws and rules are two concepts that are commonly used in the context of regulating human behavior. However, there is a difference between the two, which can be highlighted through the following points:

1.  Definition: Laws are the general set of rules and regulations that are established by the government, through legislation, to govern the conduct of individuals and organizations within a particular jurisdiction. Rules, on the other hand, are specific regulations that are framed by organizations to regulate the behavior of its members.
    
2.  Binding force: Laws are binding and enforceable by the state through the legal system. Penalties are imposed on individuals and organizations that violate the law. Rules, on the other hand, are not enforceable by the state and their violation may lead to internal sanctions within the organization.
    
3.  Purpose: Laws are enacted to protect the rights of individuals and ensure social justice, while rules are framed to maintain discipline and order within an organization.
    

The role of ethics in formulating laws and rules is significant as ethical considerations help to ensure that the laws and rules are just, fair, and equitable. Laws and rules that are ethical in nature tend to be more effective as they are supported by the moral values and principles of society.

Examples of famous laws and rules that were influenced by ethical considerations include:

1.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): The UDHR is a set of international laws that are based on the principles of human dignity, freedom, and equality. It was created by the United Nations in 1948 to protect the rights of individuals across the world. The UDHR reflects ethical considerations such as the right to life, liberty, and security of person, as well as freedom from discrimination and slavery.
    
2.  Goldman Sachs' Code of Business Conduct: Goldman Sachs is a leading financial services company that has a set of ethical rules and regulations to govern the behavior of its employees. The company's Code of Business Conduct includes ethical considerations such as integrity, transparency, and fairness in all business dealings.
    

In conclusion, laws and rules are important for regulating human behavior and ensuring social order. However, it is essential that they are influenced by ethical considerations to ensure that they are just, fair, and equitable. Ethics play a critical role in formulating laws and rules and help to ensure that they reflect the moral values and principles of society.

6.  Implementation of the solution: Once the best course of action has been determined, the final step is to implement the solution. This may involve communicating the decision to relevant stakeholders, taking any necessary legal or administrative steps, and monitoring the situation to ensure that the solution is effective.
    
7.  Review and reflection: Finally, it is important to regularly review and reflect on the ethical dilemma and the solution that was implemented. This may involve evaluating the outcome and considering whether any changes should be made to improve the process for resolving ethical dilemmas in the future.

Most of the industrial units have got environmental clearance certificate in their possession. The environmental clearance seeks to curb industries and projects that supposedly hamper environment and living species in the region, But in practice. most of these units remain to be polluting units in several ways like air, water and soil pollution. As such, local people encountered persistent health problems. It was confirmed that majority of the industries were violating environmental compliance. You issued notice to all the industrial units to apply for fresh environmental clearance certificate from the competent authority. However, your action met with hostile response from a section of the industrial units, other vested interest persons and a section of the local politicians. The workers also became hostile to you as they felt that your action would lead to the closure of these industrial units, and the resultant unemployment will lead to insecurity uncertainty in their livelihood. Many owners of the industries approached you with the plea that you should not initiate harsh action as it would compel them their units, and cause huge financial loss, shortage of their products in the market. These would obviously add to the sufferings of the labourers and the consumers alike. The labour union also sent you representation requesting against the closure of the units. You simultaneously started receiving threats from unknown corners. You however received supports from some of your colleagues, who advised you to act freely to ensure environmental compliance. Local NGOs also came to your support and they demanded the closure of the polluting units immediately.

	(b) Critically examine the options listed by you. 
	(c) What type of mechanism would you suggest to ensure environmental compliance? 
	(d) What are the ethical dilemmas you faced in exercising your option?

```ad-Answer

(a) Options available to the officer in this situation are:

1.  Taking strict action against the industrial units for violating environmental compliance
2.  Considering the pleas of the industrial unit owners and avoiding harsh action
3.  Negotiating with the industrial unit owners to reach a compromise solution
4.  Involving local NGOs, labour unions, and other stakeholders in the decision-making process
5.  Seeking support from colleagues and higher authorities to enforce environmental compliance

(b) Critical examination of options:

(c) Mechanism to ensure environmental compliance: A comprehensive mechanism that balances economic needs with environmental protection is necessary to ensure environmental compliance. This can be achieved through regular monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations, as well as providing technical and financial support to industries to upgrade their operations to meet environmental standards.

Seek the advice and assistance of a higher authority, such as a labor arbitration board, to help resolve the issue in a fair and impartial manner. c. Ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and accountable, with all relevant facts and evidence considered. d. Continue to communicate with the union and the public to provide updates on the progress of the negotiations and any decisions made.

Case study: Public Organizations DilemmaHousing vs SEZ Allocation (2020) 

Rajesh Kumar is a senior public servant, with a reputation of honesty and forthrightness, currently posted in the Finance Ministry as the Head of the Budget Division. His department is presently busy in organizing the budgetary support to the states, four of which are due to the polls within the financial year. This year’s annual budget had allotted Rs 8300 crores for the National Housing Scheme (NHS), a centrally sponsored social housing scheme for the weaker sections of society. Rs 775 crores have been drawn for NHS till June. The Ministry of Commerce had long been pursuing a case for setting up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in a southern state to boost exports. After two years of detailed discussion between the center and state, the Union Cabinet approved the project in August. The process was initiated to acquire the necessary land. Eighteen months ago a leading Public Sector Unit (PSU) had projected the need for setting up a large natural gas processing plant in a northern state for the regional gas grid. The land is already in possession of the PSU. The gas grid is an essential component of the national energy security strategy. After three rounds of global bidding, the project was allotted to an MNC, M/s XYZ Hydrocarbons. The first tranche of payment to the MNC is scheduled to be made in December. Finance Ministry was asked for a timely allocation of an additional Rs 6000 crores for these two developmental projects. It was decided to recommend re-appropriation of this entire amount from NHS allocation. The file was forwarded to the Budget Department for their comments and further processing. On studying the case file, Rajesh Kumar realized that this re-appropriation may cause an inordinate delay in the execution of NHS, a project much publicized in the rallies of senior politicians. Correspondingly, the non-availability of finances would cause a financial loss in the SEZ and national embarrassment due to delayed payment in the international project. Rajesh Kumar discussed the matter with seniors. He was conveyed that this politically sensitive situation needs to be processed immediately. Rajesh Kumar realized that diversion of funds from the NHS could raise difficult questions for the government in the Parliament. Discuss the following with reference to this case: 
1. Ethical issues involved in re-appropriation of funds from a welfare project to the development projects. 
2. Given the need for proper utilization of public funds, discuss the options available to Rajesh Kumar. Is resigning a worthy option?

```ad-Answer

1.  Ethical issues involved in re-appropriation of funds from a welfare project to the development projects: In this scenario, the ethical issues involve the proper utilization of public funds and the trade-off between two different projects, each with its own priority and importance. On one hand, the National Housing Scheme (NHS) is aimed at providing social housing for the weaker sections of society, which is a basic need for a large segment of the population. On the other hand, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and the natural gas processing plant are aimed at boosting exports and ensuring national energy security, which are important for the overall development of the country.

The re-appropriation of funds from the NHS to these two development projects raises questions of fairness, justice, and accountability. The diversion of funds from a welfare project to development projects could be seen as a prioritization of commercial interests over the basic needs of the citizens. This could result in public dissatisfaction and criticism of the government, particularly from those who would have benefitted from the NHS.

2.  Options available to Rajesh Kumar: Given the need for proper utilization of public funds, Rajesh Kumar has several options available to him.

a. Recommending re-appropriation of funds: Rajesh Kumar can recommend the re-appropriation of funds from the NHS to the development projects, as directed by his seniors. However, this option raises ethical questions about the proper utilization of public funds and the prioritization of commercial interests over the basic needs of the citizens.

b. Raising concerns: Rajesh Kumar can raise concerns about the re-appropriation of funds from the NHS, particularly in light of the public criticism that it may invite. He can request his seniors to reconsider their decision, or to allocate additional funds for the two development projects from other sources.

c. Resigning: Resigning from his post is another option available to Rajesh Kumar. This would enable him to take a stand on ethical grounds, and avoid being part of a decision that he feels is not in line with his personal values. However, resigning may also have consequences for his career and professional reputation, and may not resolve the ethical dilemma in question.

d. Seeking legal advice: Rajesh Kumar can seek legal advice on the matter and find out if there are any provisions in the law that would prevent the re-appropriation of funds from the NHS to the development projects.

In conclusion, each of the above options has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the final decision will depend on Rajesh Kumar's personal values, beliefs, and priorities. Ultimately, he will need to weigh the ethical issues involved and make a decision that he feels is in the best interests of the country and its citizens.

```ad-Answer

The crisis in the district of a frontier state is a multi-dimensional one. Narcotics menace has been rampant, resulting in money laundering, poppy farming, arms smuggling and a near stalling of education. The situation has been further worsened by unconfirmed reports that local politicians, as well as some senior police officers, are providing surreptitious patronage to the drug mafia. This has caused the system to be on the verge of collapse. 

As the newly appointed Superintendent of Police, I will take the following measures to deal with the crisis:

1. Establish a strong presence: I will ensure that the police force is present in all areas of the district and that they are visible to the public. This presence will act as a deterrent to the drug mafia and will help to restore the public’s faith in the police force. 

2. Increase patrols: I will increase the number of patrols in the district to ensure that any suspicious activity is monitored and acted upon. This will help to reduce the amount of drugs and arms being smuggled into the district. 

3. Intelligence gathering: I will establish an intelligence gathering network to monitor the activities of the drug mafia and to identify any politicians or police officers involved in providing patronage to them. This information can then be used to take action against those involved. 

4. Crackdown on poppy farming: I will launch a crackdown on poppy farming in the district. This will help to reduce the amount of drugs available and will also help to reduce the amount of money being laundered. 

5. Education: I will ensure that education in the district is not affected by the crisis. I will also provide awareness campaigns to educate the public about the dangers of drug abuse and the consequences of getting involved in drug-related activities. 

6. Collaboration with other departments: I will collaborate with other departments such as the health department, social welfare department and the education department to ensure that the crisis is dealt with in a comprehensive manner. 

7. Strict action: I will take strict action against anyone involved in the drug mafia, including politicians and police officers. This will send a strong message that such activities will not be tolerated. 

By taking these measures, I am confident that the situation in the district can be brought to normalcy. I will ensure that the public is informed of the steps being taken and that they are involved in the process. This will help to restore the public’s faith in the police force and will help to create an atmosphere of trust and security.

Case-Study: Enforcing Liquor Prohibition in Backward Area (2018) 

It is a State where prohibition is in force. You are recently appointed as the Superintendent of Police of a district notorious for illicit distillation of liquor. The illicit liquor leads to many death, reported and unreported, and causes a major problem for the district authorities. The approach till now had been to view it as a law and order problem and tackle it accordingly. Raids, arrest, police cases, and criminal trials – all these had only limited impact. The problem remains as serious as ever. Your inspections show that the parts of the district where the distillation flourishes are economically, industrially and educationally backward. Agriculture is badly affected by poor irrigation facilities. Frequent clashes among communities gave boost to illicit distillation. No major initiatives had taken place in the past either from the government’s side or from social organizations to improve the lot of the people. Which new approach will you adopt to bring the problem under control?

```ad-Answer

The approach to tackling the problem of illicit distillation of liquor in the district should shift from a purely law and order perspective to one that recognizes and addresses the underlying social, economic and educational issues. A comprehensive approach, rather than just relying on raids and arrests, would be more effective in bringing the problem under control.

First, the government and social organizations need to invest in the development of the backward regions where distillation flourishes. This can include improving irrigation facilities for agriculture, providing education and vocational training opportunities, and encouraging industrial growth. This can help to create alternative livelihoods for the people and reduce their dependence on illegal activities like distillation.

Second, it is important to involve the local community in the efforts to combat the problem. This can include creating awareness about the dangers of consuming illicit liquor, encouraging community members to report instances of distillation, and involving community leaders in discussions and decision-making. Community-based rehabilitation programs for those involved in distillation can also be implemented.

Third, effective enforcement of the prohibition law must be ensured through sustained raids and arrests, and by ensuring swift and severe punishment for the perpetrators.

It is also important to understand that the root cause of the problem is poverty, lack of education, and poor living conditions in the area. This must be addressed through various socio-economic development programs. Providing better job opportunities and education, improving the agricultural sector and infrastructure, and increasing access to health services can reduce the dependence on the illegal trade of alcohol.

Community engagement and education should be a priority. The police can work with local NGOs and social organizations to raise awareness of the dangers of consuming illicit alcohol. They can educate the local population on the impact of alcohol on their health, their families and the community as a whole.

Stricter enforcement and prosecution must be put in place. The police must be well equipped to detect and confiscate illicit alcohol production units, as well as arrest and prosecute the manufacturers. Stiff penalties for those involved in the production and sale of illicit liquor can act as a deterrent.

Alternative livelihood options must be provided to those involved in the illicit distillation of alcohol. The government can provide vocational training and employment opportunities for those who are currently involved in the illegal trade. This can help them find a legal source of income, and reduce their dependence on the illicit alcohol trade.

Finally, the police must work closely with the local administration and government to provide the necessary support to implement the proposed measures effectively. This can include providing the necessary resources, infrastructure, and training to the police, as well as coordinating with other government agencies and departments.

In conclusion, the problem of illicit distillation of alcohol cannot be solved by law enforcement alone. A multi-pronged approach, which addresses the root causes of the problem and provides alternative livelihood options, must be put in place. With the right resources and support, the police can play an important role in addressing this issue and reducing the harm caused by illicit alcohol in the district.

Now-a-days, there is an increasing thrust on economic development all around the globe. At the same time, there is also an increasing concern about environmental degradation caused by development. Many a time, we face a direct conflict between developmental activity and environmental quality. It is neither feasible to stop or curtail the development process, nor it is advisable to keep degrading the environment, as it threatens our very survival. Discuss some feasible strategies which could be adopted to eliminate this conflict and which could lead to sustainable development.

```ad-Answer


Sustainable development is a concept that has been gaining traction in recent years as the world has become increasingly aware of the necessity to balance economic growth with environmental protection. Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. One of the major challenges in achieving sustainable development is resolving the conflict between economic development and environmental degradation.

The first step in resolving this conflict is to recognize that economic development and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive. By pursuing a more holistic approach to development, it is possible to create policies that promote economic growth while also protecting the environment. This can be done by using strategies such as green growth, which seeks to promote economic growth through environmentally friendly practices. Additionally, governments should prioritize investments in renewable energy sources and green technologies, which can help reduce emissions and promote economic growth.

Another strategy for resolving the conflict between economic development and environmental degradation is to promote public-private partnerships. These partnerships can help bridge the gap between the public and private sectors, allowing them to work together to develop policies that promote economic growth while also protecting the environment. Additionally, public-private partnerships can help bring together different stakeholders to collaboratively develop solutions to environmental problems.

The third strategy for resolving this conflict is to promote public awareness and education. By educating the public about the importance of environmental protection, it can help to create a culture of sustainability. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can be used to promote the adoption of environmentally friendly practices and technologies, which can help to reduce emissions and promote economic growth.

Finally, governments should also pursue regulatory policies that promote sustainable development. This can include policies that encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, promote green technologies, and reduce emissions. Additionally, governments should also pursue policies that promote resource efficiency, such as recycling and waste management.

In conclusion, resolving the conflict between economic development and environmental degradation is essential for achieving sustainable development. This can be done by recognizing that economic development and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive, pursuing public-private partnerships, promoting public awareness and education, and pursuing regulatory policies that promote sustainable development. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more sustainable future for generations to come.

Case-Study: Why Villagers Migrate? (2014)

In our country, the migration of rural people to towns and cities is increasing drastically. This is causing serious problems both in the rural as well as in the urban areas. In fact, things are becoming really unmanageable. Can you analyze this problem in detail and indicate not only the socio-economic but also the emotional and attitudinal factors responsible for this problem? Also,
distinctly bring out why—
1. Educated rural youth are trying to shift to urban areas;
2. Landless poor people are migrating to urban slums;
3. Even some farmers are selling off their land and trying to settle in urban areas taking up petty jobs.
What feasible steps can you suggest which will be effective in controlling this serious problem of our country?

```ad-Answer

The problem of rural-urban migration in our country is a multifaceted issue that stems from socio-economic, emotional and attitudinal factors.

1.  Educated rural youth are trying to shift to urban areas due to a lack of job opportunities and lack of proper education and healthcare facilities in rural areas. They believe that the cities provide better prospects for a better quality of life and job opportunities.
    
2.  Landless poor people are migrating to urban slums due to poverty and lack of land ownership. They often face discrimination and poor living conditions, but see this as a necessary trade-off for access to better job opportunities and services.
    
3.  Some farmers are also selling their land and migrating to urban areas due to a lack of resources, changing agricultural practices and natural calamities, which have made it difficult for them to make a living through farming.
    

To address this problem, a comprehensive approach is needed that includes both short-term and long-term solutions.

Short-term solutions:

-   Providing job opportunities in rural areas: This can be achieved through promoting rural industries and small-scale businesses. The government can provide financial assistance and training to start-ups and small businesses in rural areas.
-   Improving education and healthcare facilities in rural areas: This will help reduce the gap between urban and rural areas and attract young people to stay in rural areas.
-   Providing housing and basic amenities in rural areas: The government should provide affordable housing and basic amenities like electricity, water and sanitation to rural areas to make living there more attractive.

Long-term solutions:

-   Encouraging sustainable agriculture: The government can provide subsidies, training and support to farmers to improve their livelihoods and make farming a more viable option for them.
-   Promoting rural tourism: The government can promote rural tourism and the development of rural tourism infrastructure to create job opportunities for rural people and reduce the rural-urban migration.
-   Investing in rural development: The government can invest in rural infrastructure and social services, such as schools and hospitals, to improve the quality of life in rural areas and reduce the incentive for migration.

In conclusion, the problem of rural-urban migration is a complex issue that requires a multi-pronged approach. While short-term solutions such as providing job opportunities and improving rural infrastructure can help address the issue, long-term solutions such as investing in sustainable agriculture and rural development are also needed to create a lasting impact.

Case-Study: Disaster Management (2015) 

There is a disaster-prone State having frequent landslides, forest fires, cloudbursts, flash floods and earthquakes, etc. Some of these are seasonal and often unpredictable. The magnitude of the disaster is always unanticipated. During one of the seasons, a cloudburst caused devastating floods and landslides leading to high casualties. There was major damage to infrastructure like roads, bridges and power generating units. This led to more than 100000 pilgrims, tourists and other locals trapped across different routes and locations. The people trapped in your area of responsibility included senior citizens, patients in hospitals, women and children, hikers, tourists, ruling party's regional president along with his family, additional jail. As secretary State and prisoners in jail. As a civil services officer of the State, what would be the order in which you would rescue these people and why? Give justifications

```ad-Answer

As a civil services officer in charge of disaster relief operations in the State, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety and rescue of all those affected by the disaster, regardless of their status or position. In a crisis situation like this, the priority for rescue should be based on the principles of humanity and impartiality.

1.  First priority should be given to saving lives. The immediate rescue of those in imminent danger, such as people trapped in collapsed buildings, on the verge of drowning or in critical health conditions, should be the top priority. This includes senior citizens, patients in hospitals, women and children, and other vulnerable populations.
    
2.  Next, the rescue of essential services personnel such as fire-fighters, medical personnel, and disaster management officials should be prioritized. These individuals are crucial in managing the disaster and providing necessary services to the affected population.
    
3.  Then, the rescue of tourists and hikers who may be trapped in remote areas or in areas where infrastructure has been damaged should be conducted. These individuals may be in need of medical assistance or may be in danger due to their unfamiliarity with the area.
    
4.  The rescue of prisoners and inmates from the jail should also be prioritized. While they are incarcerated, it is still the responsibility of the State to ensure their safety and well-being in the event of a disaster.
    
5.  Finally, the rescue of the ruling party's regional president along with his family and other political leaders should be carried out. While their political standing may make them a priority for some, it is important to maintain impartiality and not give preferential treatment based on political affiliations.
    

In carrying out these rescue operations, the use of available resources such as helicopters, boats, and ground-based teams should be prioritized to ensure swift and efficient rescue operations. The involvement of local communities and volunteers, who have a better understanding of the terrain and the needs of the affected population, can also be helpful in ensuring that the rescue operations are carried out effectively.

In conclusion, in a disaster-prone state, the priority for rescue should be based on the principles of humanity and impartiality, putting the lives and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their status or position, as the top priority. As a civil services officer, it is my responsibility to ensure that these principles are upheld and that all necessary measures are taken to ensure the safety and rescue of those affected by the disaster.

Case-Study: Draft Better Land-Acquisition Policy (2016) 

Land needed for mining, dams and other large-scale projects is acquired mostly from Adivasis, hill dwellers and rural communities. The displaced persons are paid monetary compensation as per the legal provisions. However, the payment is often tardy. In any case, it cannot sustain the displaced families for long. These people do not possess marketable skills to engage in some other occupation. They end up as low paid migrant labourers. Moreover, their living is destroyed. Thus, the benefits of traditional ways of community development go to industries, industrialists and urban communities whereas the costs are passed on to these poor helpless people. This unjust distribution of costs and benefits is unethical. Suppose you have been entrusted with the task of drafting a better compensation-cum-rehabilitation policy for such displaced persons, how would you approach the problem and what would be the main elements of your suggested policy?

```ad-Answer

When drafting a better compensation-cum-rehabilitation policy for displaced persons, it is important to consider the various elements of their lives that have been affected. This includes their physical, social, psychological, and economic wellbeing. The policy should also be designed to ensure that displaced persons are able to rebuild their lives in a sustainable way.

The first step in drafting a better compensation-cum-rehabilitation policy is to ensure that the displaced persons are adequately compensated for the loss of their homes, land, and livelihoods. The compensation should be sufficient to cover the costs associated with relocating, including the cost of housing, transportation, and other necessary expenses. Additionally, the compensation should be paid in a timely manner, with the option for flexible payment plans. 

The second step is to ensure that the displaced persons are able to rebuild their lives in a sustainable way. This can be achieved through the provision of education and training opportunities to help them acquire new skills and develop new sources of income. The policy should also provide access to credit and other financial assistance to help the displaced persons to start their own businesses or find employment. 

The third step is to ensure that the displaced persons are provided with adequate healthcare and nutrition. This should include access to primary healthcare services, mental health services, and nutrition education. The policy should also provide access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. 

The fourth step is to ensure that the displaced persons are provided with adequate housing. This should include access to secure and affordable housing, as well as access to basic amenities such as electricity, water, and sanitation. 

Finally, the policy should provide access to legal assistance and other forms of support to help the displaced persons to assert their rights and access their entitlements. 

In conclusion, a better compensation-cum-rehabilitation policy for displaced persons should be designed to ensure that they are adequately compensated for the loss of their homes, land, and livelihoods. The policy should also be designed to ensure that the displaced persons are able to rebuild their lives in a sustainable way, by providing access to education and training opportunities, financial assistance, healthcare and nutrition, housing, and legal assistance.
