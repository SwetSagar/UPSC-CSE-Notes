```ad-Answer

Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to understand, manage and use emotions in an effective and positive manner. In case of a crisis of conscience, where an individual is faced with a dilemma that challenges their moral and ethical values, EI can play a crucial role in helping them overcome the situation.

EI helps individuals to identify and understand their own emotions and the emotions of others, which can be useful in handling ethical and moral dilemmas. For instance, when faced with a crisis of conscience, an individual with high EI can better recognize and understand their own emotions and the emotions of others, leading to better decision-making and conflict resolution.

Additionally, EI also helps in developing empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. This can be crucial in crisis of conscience situations, as it allows individuals to consider the impact of their decisions on others, thereby helping them to make more ethical and moral choices.

However, it is important to note that emotional intelligence alone may not be enough to overcome a crisis of conscience. It is also important for individuals to have a strong moral and ethical foundation and to have a clear understanding of what they believe in. EI can help individuals to manage their emotions, but it cannot replace the importance of having a well-defined set of values and principles.

1. What are the main components of emotional intelligence (EI) ? Can they be learned? discuss. (संवेगात्मक बुद्धि के मुख्य घटक क्या हैं ? क्या उन्हें सीखा जा सकता है ? विवेचना कीजिए।) 2020

```ad-Answer

Emotional intelligence (EI) is the capacity to recognize, understand, and manage emotions. It is a set of skills that help individuals to recognize their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It is often divided into four components: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.

Self-awareness is the capacity to recognize one’s own emotions and how they affect one’s thoughts and behavior. This can help individuals to better understand themselves and their motivations.

Self-management is the ability to regulate one’s emotions in order to achieve desired outcomes. This involves understanding one’s own emotional triggers and learning to manage them.

Social awareness is the capacity to recognize emotions in others and understand their perspectives. This helps individuals to better empathize with others and build positive relationships.

Relationship management is the ability to manage the emotions of others. This involves understanding how to use emotions effectively in order to build relationships, motivate others, and resolve conflicts.

According to psychologist Daniel Goleman, “emotional intelligence is not an inborn quality but rather a set of skills that can be learned and refined with practice”. This means that individuals can learn and develop their EI skills in order to become more emotionally intelligent. Through practice and reflection, individuals can learn to recognize and understand their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. They can also learn to regulate and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.

```ad-Views

According to Daniel Goleman, the main components of Emotional Intelligence are:

1.  Self-awareness: The ability to recognize and understand one's own emotions and how they impact thoughts, behaviors, and actions.
    
2.  Self-regulation: The ability to manage and regulate one's own emotions and impulses in order to achieve desired goals and maintain a sense of control.
    
3.  Motivation: The drive to achieve goals and to pursue personal and professional success.
    
4.  Empathy: The ability to understand and identify with the emotions and experiences of others.
    
5.  Social skills: The ability to effectively communicate and build relationships with others, and to handle conflicts in a constructive manner.

1. “Emotional Intelligence is the ability to make your emotions work for you instead of against you.” Do you agree with this view? Discuss. ("संवेगात्मक बुद् धि आपके अपने संवेदों से आपके विरुद्ध कार्य करने के बजाय आपके लिए कार्य करवाने का सामर्थ्य है । क्या आप इस विचार से सहमत हैं ? विवेचना कीजिए।) 2019

```ad-Answer

Emotional intelligence allows individuals to understand and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. This skill enables them to regulate their emotions, respond appropriately to different situations and communicate effectively with others. It can help individuals in a variety of ways, including building and maintaining healthy relationships, managing stress, resolving conflicts, and making better decisions.

For example, a person with high emotional intelligence might be in a meeting and realize that one of their coworkers is feeling frustrated and upset. Instead of ignoring the colleague's emotions, this person would take the time to understand the situation and find ways to support and comfort them. This helps to foster a positive work environment, increase productivity, and ultimately benefit the entire team.

On the other hand, a person with low emotional intelligence might not recognize their own emotions or those of others, which can result in impulsive behavior and inappropriate reactions. This can lead to conflict, damaged relationships, and a negative work environment.

Emotional intelligence also helps individuals to develop self-awareness and self-regulation. Self-awareness involves recognizing one's own emotions and understanding how they impact their thoughts and behaviors. Self-regulation involves managing those emotions to ensure that they do not interfere with one's ability to think and act in a productive manner.

For example, a person with high emotional intelligence might realize that they are feeling overwhelmed and stressed. Instead of allowing those emotions to control their actions, they would take a step back, regulate their breathing, and reframe their thoughts to a more positive perspective. This helps them to maintain their composure and make better decisions, even in high-pressure situations.

1. Anger and intolerance are the enemies of correct understanding. “ _ Mahatma Gandhi. (“क्रोध और असहिष्णुता सही समझ के शत्रु हैं ।”–महात्मा गाँधी।) 2018

```ad-Answer

Mahatma Gandhi's quote highlights the importance of emotional intelligence in promoting mutual understanding and respect. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's own emotions and the emotions of others. When people are able to regulate their emotions, they are less likely to act impulsively and cause harm to others.

Anger, in particular, can be a dangerous emotion if not managed properly. When people become angry, they can become blind to reason and lash out at others. This can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and even violence. On the other hand, when people are able to understand and manage their own emotions, they can respond to situations in a calm and rational manner.

One famous example of someone who exemplified emotional intelligence is Nelson Mandela. Despite being imprisoned for 27 years for his political beliefs, Mandela was able to maintain a spirit of forgiveness and compassion towards his oppressors. He recognized that anger and hatred would not bring about the change he desired and instead chose to promote reconciliation and understanding.

Another example is Mother Teresa, who devoted her life to serving the poor and sick. Despite the hardships and suffering she faced, she maintained a spirit of compassion and love towards all those she served. This ability to understand and manage her own emotions, as well as the emotions of others, made her an effective leader and a symbol of hope for millions of people around the world.

6. “In doing a good thing, everything is permitted which is not prohibited expressly or by clear implication”. Examine the statement with suitable examples in the context of a public servant discharging his/her duties. ("अच्छा कार्य करने में, वह सब कुछ अनुमत होता है जिसको अभिव्यक्ति के द्वारा या स्पष्ट निहितार्थ के द्वारा निषिद्ध न किया गया हो ।" एक लोक सेवक द्वारा अपने कर्तव्यों का निर्वहन करने के संदर्भ में, इस कथन का उपयुक्त उदाहरणों सहित परीक्षण कीजिए।) 2018

```ad-Answer

The statement "In doing a good thing, everything is permitted which is not prohibited expressly or by clear implication" can be interpreted as a public servant having the discretion to act in the best interest of the people as long as their actions are not explicitly prohibited by law. This view emphasizes the importance of the purpose behind an action rather than solely focusing on the means by which it was achieved.

For example, a public servant working in the field of disaster management may be permitted to take quick decisions in order to save lives, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the protocols. In such situations, the priority is to provide immediate aid to those in need, and the public servant must use their judgement and emotional intelligence to determine the best course of action.

Similarly, a public servant working in the field of education may make use of innovative methods to improve the learning experience for students, as long as they do not violate any laws or ethical principles. They may organize extra-curricular activities, provide additional resources, and engage with students in ways that are not explicitly prohibited by the rules, but are still aimed at improving the overall quality of education.

However, it is important to note that this discretion must be exercised within the limits of the law and ethical principles. Public servants must not act in a manner that is illegal or unethical, even if it is for the greater good. For instance, a public servant cannot resort to corruption or abuse of power in order to achieve their goals, even if their intention is to improve the situation.

The statement highlights the importance of purpose and discretion in the actions of public servants. While they are encouraged to use their judgement and act in the best interest of the people, they must also operate within the limits of the law and ethical principles.

8. How will you apply emotional intelligence in administrative practices? (प्रशासनिक पद्धतियों में भावनात्मक बुद्धि का आप किस तरह प्रयोग करेंगे ?) 2017

```ad-Answer

Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. In the context of administrative practices, applying emotional intelligence can help improve various aspects of leadership and management. Here are some ways in which EI can be applied in administrative practices:

1.  Improved communication: Administrators who are emotionally intelligent are better at understanding the emotions of others, and thus can communicate with them more effectively. This can help to reduce misunderstandings, increase trust, and foster better relationships with employees, stakeholders, and customers.
    
2.  Conflict resolution: Administrators with strong emotional intelligence skills can effectively manage conflicts by recognizing and managing their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others involved in the conflict. This can help to resolve disputes in a more positive and productive manner.
    
3.  Effective decision-making: Administrators who are emotionally intelligent are better able to recognize and understand the emotions of those affected by their decisions. This can help them make decisions that are more informed, ethical, and equitable.
    
4.  Improved motivation and engagement: Administrators who understand and manage the emotions of their employees can create a more positive and supportive work environment, which can help to increase motivation, engagement, and productivity.
    

Examples of individuals who have demonstrated emotional intelligence in their administrative practices include:

1.  Mahatma Gandhi, who was known for his ability to understand and empathize with the emotions of others, and for using this understanding to resolve conflicts and bring about social change.
    
2.  Nelson Mandela, who used his emotional intelligence to help resolve conflicts and build a new, democratic South Africa after apartheid.
    
3.  Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, who used emotional intelligence to build strong relationships with employees and stakeholders, and to make effective decisions that increased the company's profitability and competitiveness.
    

Overall, applying emotional intelligence in administrative practices can help administrators to become more effective leaders, to make better decisions, to resolve conflicts, and to create a more positive work environment.

1. Anger is a harmful negative emotion. It is injurious to both personal life and work life. (a) Discuss how it leads to negative emotions and undesirable behaviours. (b) How can it be managed and controlled? (क्रोध एक हानिकारक नकारात्मक संवेग है । यह व्यक्तिगत जीवन एवं कार्य जीवन दोनों के लिए हानिकर है। (a) चर्चा कीजिए कि यह किस प्रकार नकारात्मक संवेगों और अवांछनीय व्यवहारों को पैदा कर देता है । (b) इसे कैसे व्यवस्थित एवं नियंत्रित किया जा सकता है ? ) 2016

```ad-Answer


(a) Anger is a powerful emotion that can have a profound effect on our lives. It can lead to negative emotions such as fear, guilt, and shame, as well as undesirable behaviours such as aggression, violence, and even self-harm. Anger can also lead to a lack of motivation, poor decision-making, and a decrease in productivity. It can also lead to a breakdown in relationships, as it can be difficult to communicate effectively when feeling angry.

When we experience anger, our body releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause physical reactions such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. This can lead to further negative emotions, such as frustration and despair. Furthermore, anger can lead to a decrease in empathy and understanding, making it difficult to resolve conflicts and reach a solution.

(b) Although anger is a normal emotion, it is important to learn how to manage and control it. One way to do this is to recognize the signs of anger and take steps to prevent it from escalating. This may include taking deep breaths, counting to 10, or walking away from the situation. It is also important to practice self-care and get plenty of rest, as this can help to reduce stress and prevent anger from escalating.

It can also be helpful to talk to someone about your feelings and to express your anger in a constructive way. This could involve writing down your thoughts and feelings, or talking to a friend or family member. It is also important to practice self-reflection and to identify the underlying causes of your anger. This could involve examining your values and beliefs and considering how they may be contributing to your feelings.

Finally, it is important to practice relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation. These can help to reduce stress and to focus on the present moment. Additionally, it is important to seek professional help if needed, as a therapist can help to identify the root causes of your anger and provide strategies to manage and control it.

9. All human beings aspire for happiness. Do you agree? What does happiness mean to you? Explain with examples. (सभी मानव सुख की आकांक्षा करते हैं। क्या आप सहमत है? आपके लिए सुख का क्या अर्थ है? उदाहरण प्रस्तुत करते हुए स्पष्ट कीजिए।) 2014

```ad-Answer

Yes, it is widely accepted that all human beings aspire for happiness. Happiness is a subjective and complex emotion that is essential for leading a fulfilling life. It can mean different things to different people, but it is generally defined as a positive emotion that arises from a sense of contentment, satisfaction, and well-being.

To me, happiness is the ability to experience joy and fulfillment in life. It is about finding balance between our emotional, psychological, physical, and spiritual well-being. It can come from both external and internal sources and is often a result of personal growth, meaningful relationships, and a sense of purpose.

For example, a person who enjoys spending time with loved ones and finds joy in everyday activities may experience happiness in a simple, but profound way. A person who is fulfilled by their work and is making a difference in the world, may find happiness in their professional accomplishments. A person who has a strong connection to their inner self and is able to appreciate the beauty in life, may experience happiness through spiritual growth.

In order to apply emotional intelligence in administrative practices, it is essential to understand and cultivate the emotional well-being of the employees and the organization. Emotional intelligence helps individuals recognize and regulate their own emotions, as well as understand and empathize with the emotions of others.

For instance, a manager with high emotional intelligence may take steps to create a positive and supportive work environment that promotes employee well-being and happiness. They may engage in regular check-ins with employees to assess their emotional state, provide opportunities for personal and professional growth, and create a culture of open communication and mutual respect.

1. What is 'emotional intelligence' and how can it be developed in people? How does it help an individual in taking ethical decisions? (‘भावात्मक प्रज्ञता’ क्या होता है और यह लोगों में किस प्रकार विकसित किया जा सकता है? किसी व्यक्ति विशेष को नैतिक निर्णय लेने में यह कैसे सहायक होता है?) 2013

```ad-Answer

Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to a person's ability to identify, understand, and manage their own emotions and the emotions of others. 

Developing Emotional Intelligence:

1.  Self-awareness: The first step in developing emotional intelligence is to become aware of your own emotions, thoughts and behaviors and how they impact others. This involves paying attention to your inner experiences and reflecting on how your emotions influence your thoughts and actions.
    
2.  Emotional regulation: Once you are aware of your emotions, it is important to learn how to manage them effectively. This means learning techniques to calm down when you're feeling overwhelmed, and to avoid impulsive reactions that may cause harm to others.
    
3.  Empathy: Emotional intelligence also involves the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others. This involves paying attention to other people's expressions, body language and tone of voice and then responding in a way that is sensitive and appropriate.
    
4.  Social skills: Effective communication and interpersonal skills are also important components of emotional intelligence. This means learning how to listen actively, ask questions, express your thoughts and feelings clearly, and resolve conflicts in a constructive manner.
    
5.  Continuous learning and growth: Finally, developing emotional intelligence involves a lifelong commitment to personal growth and learning. This means being open to feedback, learning from your experiences and seeking opportunities to practice new skills and behaviors.
    

In terms of taking ethical decisions, emotional intelligence can help individuals in several ways. Firstly, it can help individuals to be more self-aware and better understand their own emotions and motivations. This in turn can help to reduce the influence of personal biases and allow individuals to make decisions that are in line with their values and principles.

Secondly, emotional intelligence can help individuals to develop better interpersonal skills and empathy, which can help them to understand the perspectives and emotions of others. This can facilitate more effective communication and collaboration and increase the likelihood of reaching mutually beneficial outcomes.

Finally, individuals with high emotional intelligence tend to have strong self-regulation skills, which can help them to resist the temptation to engage in unethical behavior. They are better able to control their impulses, maintain a level head and make decisions that are consistent with their values, even in challenging situations.

13. What do you understand by the term 'voice of conscience'? How do you prepare yourself to heed to the voice of conscience? (‘अंत करण की आवाज’ से आप क्या समझते है? आप स्वयं को अंतः करण की आवाज पर ध्यान देने के लिए कैसे तैयार करते हैं?) 2013

```ad-Answer

The term ‘voice of conscience’ refers to an inner sense of right and wrong that guides a person’s behaviour and choices. It is the inner voice that speaks to us, telling us what is right and wrong. It is the inner voice that helps us make decisions and take action in accordance with our moral values and beliefs.

The voice of conscience is a powerful force that can help us make the right decisions and guide us towards a moral and ethical life. It is often seen as a moral compass that helps us determine what is right and wrong. It can be a source of strength and guidance in difficult situations.

The voice of conscience is based on our own moral values and beliefs. It is shaped by the values and beliefs that we have been taught by our parents, teachers, and religious leaders. It is also shaped by our own experiences and observations. As we get older, our moral values and beliefs may change, but the voice of conscience remains the same.

In order to heed to the voice of conscience, it is important to be aware of our own values and beliefs and to be able to recognize when the voice of conscience is speaking to us. It is also important to be open to change and to recognize when our values and beliefs have changed.

One way to prepare oneself to heed to the voice of conscience is to take time to reflect on one’s values and beliefs. Taking time to reflect on what we believe in and why can help us to be more aware of our own moral values and beliefs. It can also help us to recognize when the voice of conscience is speaking to us.

Another way to prepare oneself to heed to the voice of conscience is to practice making decisions based on our own moral values and beliefs. This can be done by making small decisions throughout the day that are based on our values and beliefs. For example, if we believe in being kind to others, we can practice being kind to those around us. This can help us to build our moral values and beliefs and to be more aware of the voice of conscience.

Finally, it is important to practice listening to the voice of conscience and to be willing to act on it. This means being willing to make decisions and take action even when it is difficult or unpopular. It also means being willing to accept the consequences of our decisions and to learn from them.

By taking the time to reflect on our own values and beliefs, practicing making decisions based on our own values and beliefs, and being willing to listen to the voice of conscience and act on it, we can prepare ourselves to heed to the voice of conscience. Doing so can help us to make the right decisions and to lead a moral and ethical life.

3.  "In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing. The worst thing you can do is nothing." - Theodore Roosevelt
    
4.  "The greatest tragedy in life is not death, but a life without a purpose." - Robert Byrne
    
5.  "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." - Edmund Burke
    

These quotes highlight the importance of acting in accordance with one's conscience and the consequences of ignoring it. A crisis of conscience can be a difficult and challenging experience, but it is also an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to navigate this internal conflict and make decisions that align with their moral and ethical values.

Case Study: Compassionchild labour in Cotton farm (2020)

Rampura, a remote district inhabited by a tribal population, is marked by extreme backwardness and abject poverty. Agriculture is the mainstay of the local population, though it is subsistence due to the very small landholdings. There is insignificant industrial or mining activity. Even the targeted welfare programs have inadequately benefited the tribal population. In this restrictive scenario, the youth has begun to migrate to other states to supplement the family income. Plight of minor girls is that their parents are persuaded by labour contractors to send them to work in the Bt Cotton farms of a nearby state. The soft fingers of the minor girls are well suited for plucking the cotton. The inadequate living and working conditions in these farms have caused serious health issues for the minor girls. NGOs in the districts of domicile and the cotton farms appear to be compromised and have not effectively espoused the twin issues of child labour and development of the area.
You are appointed as the District Collector of Rampura. Identify the ethical issues involved. Which specific steps will you initiate to ameliorate the conditions of minor girls of your district and to improve the overall economic scenario in the district.

```ad-Answer

The ethical issues involved in the situation in Rampura district are primarily related to child labor and human rights. The exploitation of minor girls for labor is a clear violation of the provisions of the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, which prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in certain hazardous occupations. Additionally, the poor living and working conditions in the cotton farms pose a serious threat to the health and well-being of these girls.

Furthermore, the issue of the migration of young people from Rampura district and the exploitation of minor girls highlights the larger issue of poverty and lack of economic opportunities in the area. This situation is a clear indication of the failure of the government's targeted welfare programs, which have failed to provide adequate benefits to the tribal population.

In my role as the District Collector of Rampura, I would initiate the following steps to address these ethical issues and improve the overall economic scenario in the district:

1.  Conduct an investigation into the exploitation of minor girls for labor in the cotton farms, and take appropriate legal action against the employers and labor contractors involved.
    
2.  Work with the relevant authorities to ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act in the cotton farms, and provide rehabilitation and education facilities for the rescued minor girls.
    
3.  Launch a program to create awareness among the parents of the district about the dangers of child labor and the provisions of the law that protect children from exploitation.
    
4.  Promote the development of alternative livelihood options in the district, such as vocational training and micro-enterprise development programs, to reduce the dependence of the people on migration and child labor as a means of supplementing their income.
    
5.  Engage with NGOs and other civil society organizations to raise awareness about the issues facing the people of Rampura, and to mobilize public support for the development of the district.
    
6.  Advocate for increased government investment in the district to address the root causes of poverty and lack of economic opportunities, such as by improving infrastructure, increasing access to credit, and promoting agriculture and other local industries.

Case Study: compassion for migrant workers in corona (2020)

Migrant workers have always remained at the socio-economic margins of our society, silently serving as the instrumental labour force of urban economics. The pandemic has brought them into national focus. On announcement of a countrywide lockdown, a very large number of migrant workers decided to move back from their places of employment to their native villages. The non-availability of transport created its own problems. Added to this was the fear of starvation and inconvenience to their families. This caused, the migrant workers to demand wages and transport facilities for returning to their villages. Their mental agony was accentuated by multiple factors such as a sudden loss of livelihood, possibility of lack of food and inability to assist in harvesting their rabi crop due to not being able to reach home in time. Reports of inadequate response of some districts in providing the essential boarding and lodging arrangements along the way multiplied their fears. You have learnt many lessons from this situation when you were tasked to oversee the functioning of the District Disaster Relief Force in your district. In your opinion what ethical issues arose in the current migrant crisis? What do you understand by an ethical care giving state? What assistance can the civil society render to mitigate the sufferings of migrants in similar situations?

```ad-Answer

The recent migrant crisis brought to light several ethical issues that arose in the handling of the situation by the government and the society at large. Some of these issues include:

1.  Dignity of Labor: Migrant workers, who form a significant part of the labor force, were suddenly deprived of their livelihoods and were forced to walk hundreds of miles to their native villages due to the sudden announcement of the nationwide lockdown. This lack of proper planning and arrangement to support them in their time of need violated their right to work with dignity.
    
2.  Human Rights Violations: Many workers reported lack of adequate food, shelter, and medical facilities during their journey, which violated their basic human rights. The lack of transport facilities, quarantine arrangements and inadequate response from the districts in providing essential boarding and lodging arrangements further compounded their suffering.
    
3.  Lack of Social Responsibility: The civil society, including corporate houses, and other entities failed to come forward to support the migrants in their hour of need. The government, too, did not provide adequate support in terms of food, shelter, and medical facilities to these workers who were in dire need of assistance.
    

An ethical care-giving state is one that prioritizes the well-being and safety of its citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status. In the current migrant crisis, the state failed to provide adequate support and assistance to the migrant workers, which goes against the principles of an ethical care-giving state.

The civil society can play a crucial role As a civil servant, one of the most important ethical issues that arose during the migrant crisis was the responsibility to provide basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care to the workers who were stranded and in need of assistance. It was the government's duty to ensure that these workers were not left to fend for themselves, and that they were given the support they needed to make it back to their homes safely. This meant that the government had to work quickly to set up food and shelter arrangements, as well as medical care for those who were sick or injured.

Another important ethical issue was the responsibility to ensure that the workers' rights were protected, and that they were not subjected to exploitation or abuse. This meant that the government had to take steps to prevent employers from taking advantage of the workers' vulnerability, and to ensure that they were paid the wages they were owed. The government also had to work to prevent discrimination against the workers, and to ensure that they were not subjected to any form of violence or abuse.

An ethical care-giving state is one that places the well-being of its citizens at the forefront of its priorities, and works to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect. It is a state that is responsive to the needs of its citizens, and works to provide them with the support and assistance they need in times of crisis. An ethical care-giving state recognizes that its citizens are its most important resource, and that it has a responsibility to protect and support them, especially in times of crisis.

The civil society can play an important role in mitigating the suffering of migrants in similar situations. For example, NGOs and community organizations can work to provide food and shelter to the workers, and can also advocate on their behalf to ensure that their rights are protected. The civil society can also work to educate the public about the plight of the workers, and to raise awareness about the importance of treating them with dignity and respect.

Case-Study: ineligible beneficiary for health-scheme (2018)

Rakesh is a responsible district level officer, who enjoys the trust of his higher officials. Knowing his honesty, the government entrusted him with the responsibility of identifying the beneficiaries under a health care scheme meant for senior citizens. The criteria to be a beneficiary are the following: 1. 60 years of age or above. 2. Belonging to a reserved community. 3. Family income of less than 1 Lakh rupees per annum. 4. Post-treatment prognosis is likely to be high to make a positive difference to the quality of life of the beneficiary. One day, an old couple visited Rakesh’s office with their application. They have been the residents of a village in his district since their birth. The old man is diagnosed with a rare condition that causes obstruction in the large intestine. As a consequence, he has severe abdominal pain frequently that prevents him from doing any physical labour. The couple has no children to support them. The expert surgeon whom they contacted is willing to do the surgery without charging any fee. However, the couple will have to bear the cost of incidental charges, such as medicines, hospitalization, etc., to the tune of rupees one lakh. The couple fulfils all the criteria except criterion ‘b’. However, any financial aid would certainly make a significant difference in their quality of life. How should Rakesh respond to the situation?

```ad-Answer

Rakesh is faced with an ethical dilemma, as the couple does not fulfil one of the criteria for being a beneficiary of the health care scheme, yet their situation is dire and aid from the scheme would greatly improve their quality of life. Rakesh has a responsibility to act in the best interest of the citizens and ensure that the scheme is implemented fairly and transparently.

One approach for Rakesh could be to consider the exceptional circumstances of the couple's situation and provide them with the financial aid from the scheme, despite them not fulfilling the criterion of belonging to a reserved community. He could consider the humanitarian aspect of the situation and make an exception for the couple.

Another approach could be to follow the strict criteria set by the government and not provide the financial aid to the couple, as they do not fulfil the requirement of belonging to a reserved community. Rakesh could also explore alternative options to help the couple, such as reaching out to philanthropic organizations or other government schemes that could provide financial assistance.

The best option for Rakesh would be to prioritize the criteria of the health care scheme and to ensure that the decision he takes is in line with the established rules and regulations. He can also take into consideration the humanitarian aspect of the situation and assess whether providing the couple with financial aid would make a significant difference in their quality of life, as per criterion 4.

Other options that Rakesh could consider are:

1.  Seeking guidance from his higher-ups: Rakesh can seek guidance from his higher-ups and discuss the situation with them. They may have a different perspective and can provide a solution that adheres to the established rules and regulations.
    
2.  Providing aid through a different scheme: If the couple does not fulfil criterion ‘b’, Rakesh can explore the possibility of providing aid through a different scheme or through a discretionary fund.
    
3.  Partnering with local NGOs or private organizations: Rakesh can collaborate with local NGOs or private organizations to raise funds for the couple.
    
4.  Re-evaluating the criteria of the health care scheme: Rakesh can assess whether the criteria of the health care scheme are in line with the current needs and make recommendations for any necessary changes.
    

Ultimately, Rakesh needs to ensure that the decision he takes is in line with the established rules and regulations and prioritizes the welfare of the citizens.

Case-Study: IRS officer’s compassion for a public-spirited Doctor (2018)

Dr X is a leading medical practitioner in a city. He has set up a charitable trust through which he plans to establish a super-speciality hospital in the city to cater to the medical needs of all sections of the society. Incidentally, that part of the State had been neglected over the years. The proposed hospital would be a boon for the region. You are heading the tax investigation agency of that region. During an inspection of the doctor’s clinic, your officers have found out some major irregularities. A few of them are substantial which had resulted in considerable withholding of tax that should be paid by him now. The doctor is cooperative. He undertakes to pay the tax immediately. However, there are certain other deficiencies in his tax compliance which are purely technical in nature. If these technical defaults are pursued by the agency, considerable time and energy of the doctor will be diverted to issues which are not so serious, urgent or even helpful to the tax collection process. Further, in all probability, it will hamper the prospects of the hospital coming up. There are two options before you: 1. Taking a broader view, ensure substantial tax compliance and ignore defaults that are merely technical in nature. 2. Pursue the matter strictly and proceed on all fronts,whether substantial or merely technical. As the head of the tax agency, which course of action will you opt and why?

```ad-Answer

As the head of the tax investigation agency, the most appropriate course of action would be to take a broader view and ensure substantial tax compliance while ignoring defaults that are merely technical in nature. This is because pursuing all the technical deficiencies, even if they are minor, would not only divert the doctor's time and energy away from more pressing issues, but it would also hinder the prospects of the hospital coming up. The proposed super-speciality hospital would benefit the entire region and cater to the medical needs of all sections of society, so ensuring its establishment should be a priority.

Moreover, the doctor has been cooperative and has undertaken to pay the tax immediately, indicating a willingness to rectify his mistakes and comply with the regulations. The tax collection process can be carried out in a way that does not affect the establishment of the hospital. For instance, the agency could opt for a lenient approach by giving the doctor a deadline to rectify the technical defaults and ensuring that the substantial tax compliance is achieved.

An ethical care-giving state should prioritize the welfare of its citizens and ensure that important public services are not hindered by bureaucratic regulations. In this case, the establishment of the super-speciality hospital would improve the healthcare system in the region and benefit the citizens. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the tax agency to overlook minor technical deficiencies and ensure that the hospital is set up as soon as possible.

Case-Study: Help accident victim on interview day? (2017)

You are aspiring to become an IAS officer and you have cleared various stages and now you have been selected for the personal interview. On the day of the interview, on the way to the venue you saw an accident where a mother and child who happen to be your relatives were badly injured. They needed immediate help. What would you have done in such a situation? Justify your action.

```ad-Answer

In such a situation, my immediate priority would be to provide help to the injured mother and child, who are my relatives, even if it means risking my chance of becoming an IAS officer. Helping those in need is an ethical responsibility and a human obligation, and it takes precedence over personal goals and ambitions.

I would take the following steps to provide assistance:

1.  I would call for an ambulance to ensure that the mother and child receive medical attention as soon as possible.
2.  I would stay with them at the hospital and ensure that they receive the necessary medical treatment and care.
3.  I would inform my family members and other relatives about the accident and the steps I have taken to provide assistance.

In case the personal interview was already underway, I would inform the interview panel about the situation and request them to reschedule the interview. I believe that honesty and transparency are important values, and I would not want to be deceptive or misleading in any way.

Case-Study: Child Labourers in Sivakasi (2013)

Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu is known for its manufacturing clusters on firecrackers and matches. The local economy of the area is largely dependent on firecrackers industry. It has led to tangible economic development and improved standard of living in the area. So far as child labour norms for hazardous industries like firecrackers industry are concerned, International Labour Organization (ILO) has set the minimum age as 18 years. In India, however, this age is 14 years. The units in industrial clusters of firecrackers can be classified into registered and non-registered entities. One typical unit is household-based work. Though the law is clear on the use of child labour employment norms in registered/non-registered units, it does not include household-based works. Household-based work means children working under the supervision of their parents/ relatives. To evade child labour norms, several units project themselves as household-based works but employ children from outside. Needless to say that employing children saves the costs for these units leading to higher profits to the owners. On your visit to one of the units at Sivakasi, the owner takes you around the unit which has about 10-15 children below 14 years of age. The owner tells you that in his household-based unit, the children are all his relatives. You notice that several children smirk, when the owner tells you this. On deeper enquiry, you figure out that neither the owner nor the children are able to satisfactorily establish their relationship with each other. 1. Bring out and discuss the ethical issues involved in the above case. 2. What would be your reaction after your above visit?

```ad-Answer

In this scenario, there are several ethical issues involved. The first and foremost issue is the use of child labor. As per the International Labour Organization (ILO) norms, the minimum age for working in hazardous industries like firecracker production should be 18 years. In India, the minimum age is 14 years, but still, employing children in this industry is considered unethical and violative of their rights as minors.

The next ethical issue is related to the owner's manipulation of the definition of "household-based work". The owner is presenting the children working in his unit as relatives, but in reality, they are children from outside who have been employed to save costs and increase profits. This is a clear case of exploitation of children who are made to work in hazardous conditions, thereby violating their rights to education, safety, and health.

In such a scenario, the ethical reaction of a responsible individual would be to bring the issue to the attention of the relevant authorities. The person could approach the labor department and file a complaint about the exploitation of children. The person could also bring the matter to the notice of the media and other relevant organizations that are working to eliminate child labor and promote the rights of children.

Another important step would be to educate the owner and the workers about the ethical implications of employing children in hazardous industries. The person could also extend support and help in arranging alternative sources of livelihood for the owner, so that he is not dependent on child labor.

In conclusion, the use of child labor in the firecracker industry is a clear violation of the ethical and legal norms. It is the responsibility of individuals and organizations to take appropriate action to stop such practices and protect the rights of children. The state should also enforce strict measures to eliminate child labor in hazardous industries and provide alternative sources of livelihood for those who are dependent on it.

Case-Study: Dalit Cook in Mid-day Meal (2015)

You are the Sarpanch of a Panchayat. There is a primary school run by the government in your area. Midday meals are provided to the children attending the school. The Headmaster has now appointed a new cook in the school to prepare the meals. However, when it is found that the cook is from Dalit community, almost half of the children belonging to higher castes are not allowed to take meals by their parents. Consequently the attendance in the school falls sharply. This could result in the possibility of discontinuation of midday meal scheme, thereafter of teaching staff and subsequent closing down the school. 1. Discuss some feasible strategies to overcome the conflict and to create right ambience. 2. What should be the responsibilities of different social segments and agencies to create positive social ambience for accepting such changes?

```ad-Answer

Dealing with social conflicts like caste-based discrimination in a primary school is a complex issue and requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can be employed to overcome this conflict:

1.  Education and Awareness: It is important to educate the community, especially the parents, about the importance of education and the negative consequences of denying children access to midday meals. Workshops and seminars can be organized to raise awareness about the issue and the importance of promoting equality and inclusiveness in the education system.
    
2.  Engagement with Parents: Personalized engagement with the parents who are preventing their children from taking midday meals is important. It is important to understand their concerns and to find ways to address them. They should be informed about the benefits of the midday meal scheme and how it can help in the overall development of their children.
    
3.  Community Involvement: The community should be involved in the decision-making process and in the monitoring of the midday meal scheme. This can be done through regular community meetings, where the parents and community members can voice their concerns and be part of the solution.
    
4.  Support from Government Agencies: The local administration, education department, and other government agencies should provide support to the school in addressing the issue. The agencies can also provide resources and technical assistance to help the school overcome the problem.
    
5.  Role of Media: The media can play an important role in highlighting the issue and creating awareness about the importance of education and inclusiveness. They can also be used to monitor the progress of the school and to bring attention to any issues that arise.
    

In terms of responsibilities, different social segments and agencies have a role to play in creating a positive social atmosphere for accepting changes:

1.  Government: The government has the primary responsibility of ensuring that all children have access to education and that the education system is inclusive. It should provide support to the school in overcoming the conflict and ensuring that the midday meal scheme continues.
    
2.  School: The school should ensure that all children have access to the midday meal scheme and that there is no discrimination based on caste, religion, or other social status. The school should also work with the community and the government to find solutions to the problem.
    
3.  Parents: Parents have a responsibility to ensure that their children have access to education and to support the school in providing a positive learning environment. They should also be encouraged to participate in the decision-making process and to provide feedback on the midday meal scheme.
    
4.  Community: The community should work together to support the school and to create a positive social atmosphere for accepting changes. They should also participate in the decision-making process and help monitor the progress of the school.
    
5.  NGOs and Civil Society: NGOs and civil society organizations can provide support to the school and the community in addressing the issue. They can also raise awareness about the importance of education and inclusiveness, and provide technical and financial assistance to help overcome the problem.

Case-Study: Poor woman without documentary proof? (2016)

Suppose you are an officer in-charge of implementing a social service scheme to provide support to old and destitute women. An old and illiterate woman comes to you to avail the benefits of the scheme. However, she has no documents to show that she fulfils the eligibility criteria. But after meeting her and listening to her you feel that she certainly needs support. Your enquiries also show that she is really destitute and living in a pitiable condition. You are in a dilemma as to what to do. Putting her under the scheme without are documents would clearly be violation of rules. But denying her the support would be cruel and inhuman.

1. Can you think of a rational way to resolve this dilemma?
2. Give your reasons for it

```ad-Answer

1.  To resolve the dilemma, one approach could be to verify the woman's eligibility for the scheme through alternative means, such as seeking a certificate from the local authorities or taking statements from local residents who know her. This would provide a documented proof of her eligibility for the scheme and would also mitigate the risk of violating the rules.
    
2.  This approach is rational as it balances the conflicting interests of following the rules and providing support to the deserving. It also ensures that the scheme's resources are utilized judiciously and are not misused. Additionally, seeking alternative means of verification also upholds the transparency and accountability of the scheme, as it provides a clear and documented proof of the woman's eligibility.
    

Moreover, this approach also takes into consideration the humanity aspect, as it seeks to address the plight of the old and destitute woman while at the same time ensuring the proper implementation of the scheme. In a situation where rules and humanitarian considerations are at odds, a rational approach would be to find a middle ground that accommodates both interests.
