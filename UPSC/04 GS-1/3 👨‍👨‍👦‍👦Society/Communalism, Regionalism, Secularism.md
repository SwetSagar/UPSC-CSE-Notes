-   Secularism opposed all forms of inter(in between religions) and intra (within religions) religious domination.
 
## 4.1 How to promotes Secularism?
-   Education
-   Separation of state from religion
-   State should not have a formal or a legal alliance with any religion
-   Strict separation of state and religion is a feature of most western countries. This does not allow equality to prevail within and among religions.
-   Indian secularism deals with the inter and intra religious equality, religious minorities, state supports religious reforms.
-   Indian secularism's engagement with religion could be positive (right to establish their own educational institution) and negative (opposing religious tyranny like abolishing untouchability)


## 4.2 Criticism of Indian Secularism 
-   Anti-religious : disrespect to dogma, fanaticism, hatred and intervention in these by state.
-   Secularism is a Western Import : it has a both western and non-western origin
-   Minoritism
-   Interventionist - it is not coercive but constructive
-   Vote Bank politics -
-   Impossible to attain complete secularism
