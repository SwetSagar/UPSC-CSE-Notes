-   Non Standard assets are NPAs - Various stages that a loan undergoes under this are
    -   Special Mention Account when dues are not paid for 90 days
    -   Sub Standard Asset when it remains SMA till 12 months
    -   After 12 months it is called as a Doubtful asset DA1 it becomes DA2 1-3 years from 3 yr onwards it is classified as DA3.

#####   Various steps that could be taken/were taken to clear NPAs are :
-   Provisioning
-   Capital adequacy norms of Basel 3 ^1daf5f
-   **SARFAESI Act** : Securitisation means the selling of securities that were basis of loans. 
-   [[#ARCs]] ^3828d8
-   Foreclosure - taking over the mortgage
-   One Time settlement
-   Interest waiver
- 5/25 refinancing

<p></p>
#### SARFAESI Act 
- Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002 
- allows banks to auction residential and commercial properties to recover loans without permission of courts
- Banks/FIs that have 75% of loan due can issue notice of default to borrowers asking to clear it and on failure can 
	- take possession of security
	- take over management of borrowing concern 
	- appt manage the concern
- Can also sell security to ARC

#### ARCs 
- under the act can buy NPAs from banks and turn them around to become productive. 
- **RBI gives licenses to them and regulates** them. 
- They clean up the balance sheet of banks, monetise assets etc. 
- can also reschedule debts, change or takeover Management.

-  SARFAESI Act 2002 provides legal basis for setting up ARC.
-  Should have min net owned fund of Rs 100cr and [[#^1303a6 | Capital Adequacy Ratio]] of 15%. 

#### Prompt Corrective Action PCA 
-  PCA is taken when the risk thresh hold is breached it is related to asset quality, profitability, capital levels etc. Banks are then put under watch by RBI.
- Introduced in 2002 as structured early intervention mechanism aims to check NPAs.

#### Risks
-   Credit risk is when borrowers are not able to repay loans
-   Market risk is when the SLR that is invested in gold, Bonds, currency etc fluctuate in prices
-   Operational risk includes fraud, cyber-attacks, infra shutdowns etc

#### Capital Adequacy Ratio 
- Banks want to minimise risk and maximise their credit creation. Thus there are tools to act as shock absorbers/ cushion to banks : 
	- **Cash Reserve Ratio CRR**
	- **Statutory Liquidity Ratio SLR**
	- **Capital Adequacy Ratio CAR**
-   Capital Adequacy Ratio CAR aka CRAR is % of a banks risk weighted credit exposures. Every borrower has a certain risk associated with them. Gov securities and Cash have zero risk. Basel III says it should be 8% and RBI 9% , decided by Central Bank and regulators ^1303a6
	- It means that if loans of Rs 100 is being forwarded a free capital of Rs 8 is to be maintained at that particular time. 
	- RBI introduced it in 1992.
	- **Risk-weighted assets** are the loans and other assets of a bank, weighted (that is, multiplied by a percentage factor) to reflect their respective level of risk of loss to the bank.
	> CAR = (Tier 1 + Tier 2 capital) / Risk Weighted Assets
 - **Tier 1 capital** : which can absorb losses without bank being required to cease trading. They are most reliable and liquid ex equity capital and disclosed reserves of bank.
 - **Tier 2 capital** : which can absorb losses in event bank has to cease trading. Consists of accumulated after tax surplus of retained earnings, revaluation reserves of fixed assets, long term holding of equity securities, general loan loss reserves, hybrid capital instruments, subordinate debts and undisclosed reserves.
 - **Tier 3 capital** :  Considered tertiary capital and includes greater number of subordinated issues, undisclosed reserves, general loss reserves not included in Tier 2 capital.
-   Maintaining CAR is a challenge in India due to NPAs, dwindling profits to listed companies, low infusion of capital of GOI
-   Hair cut is when the value of an asset is brought down when it cannot be realised fully - 2 types a write down where it is decrease and a write off dec to 0.

#### Basel Norms
-   **Basel I** 1998 focus entirely on credit risk and on on capital adequacy of financial institution. 
-   **Basel II** 2004 focused on more risks and remedies and on minimum capital requirements, supervisory review and market discipline.
-   **Basel III** 2010-2011 - improve quantity and quality of capital, strong supervision, risk management and disclosure standards. - **Basel III** on banking sectors ability to absorb shock from financial & economic reserves, improve risk mgt and governance, strengthen banks.
    -   Under this capital adequacy was inc to 11.5% against 9
    -   covers 3 risks credit risk, market risk and operational risk
    -   3 pillars :
        -   Pillar I is risks
        -   2 enlarges the role of banking supervisors
        -   3 deals with higher disclosure by banks on capital adequacy, asset quality etc
