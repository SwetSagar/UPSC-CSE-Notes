## Energy Flow
 - Flow of energy *from producer to top consumers* aka Energy Flow always unidirectional and from lower to higher. 
 - There is loss of energy as heat in each trophic level, it decreases while going upwards.
-   Trophic level interaction deals with how the mem of ecosys are connected.
 
- **Food chain** : sequence of organisms that **feed on one another**. Types are Grazing food chain and Detritus food chain : starts from dead organic matter which is initial source.
-   **Food web** : *all possible transfers of energy and nutrients* among the organisms in an ecosystem.

###  Ecological Pyramids 
- each levels of trophic shown, length of horizontal bar is number of Individuals divided into
-   **Pyramid of numbers** : horizontal bars represent the number of individuals.
	- It can be partially upright ex in forest ecosystem where herbivores are more in number than the producers.
	- Ex of inverted pyramid is found in parasitic food chains where thousands  of parasites feed on one body. 
-   **Pyramid of Biomass** : individuals are weighted instead of being counted i.e their dry weight measured in g/m2. 
	- Most eco pyramids on lands are upward and aquatic pyramids are inverted.
-   **Pyramid of Energy** : It shows the conversion of energy and heat energy at each trophic level. 
	- It is *always upwards* with a large energy base. 
	- This concept helps to explain the biological magnification phenomena.

### Pollutants and Trophic levels
-   **Bioaccumulation** : Refers to the *accumulation of a toxic chemical in the tissue of a particular organism*. 
	- how pollutants enter a food chain, inc in conc of pollutant from *env to first organism in a food chain*.
	-   DDT is not a biologically active ie not toxic to humans but it accumulates in the tissue of animals causing Bioaccumulation.
-   **Biomagnification** : refers to the *increased concentration of a toxic chemical the higher an animal is on the food chain*. 
	- ie tendency of pollutant to inc its conc from one trophic level to the next. 
	- The pollutant must be *long-lived, mobile, soluble in fats, biologically active* 
	- They are generally present in fatty tissues of animals.
	- But when DDT accumulated organism is consumed by another organism of higher trophic level the concentration of DDT in the body increases.

#### Types of Biotic Interaction 
- Neutralism is 0,0

### Bio-geo Chemical Cycle
-   **Bio Geo chemical cycle** : cyclic movement of mineral nutrients from non-living to living and back
-   Nutrient cycle type of BGC Cycle shows how nutrients move from physical env to living organsims and then back. Eg **Carbon** and **Nitrogen** cycles. They are of 2 types :
    -   Perfect cycle where they are replaced as soon as consumed eg gaseous cycles
    -   Imperfect cycle : some nutrients are lost from cycle eg sedimentary cycle.
 
#### Gaseouse cycles 
- in this the reservoirs are atmosphere and hydrosphere
 
**Water Cycle**

**Carbon Cycle**

**Nitrogen Cycle**
-   The various ways of Nitrogen fixation are :
    -   By microorganisms : free living bacteria eg azotobacter and **anaerobic clostridium** and symbiotic bacteria eg Rhizobium, Anabeaena Spirulina.
    -   by man using industrial processes far exceeds natural fixation
    -   Atmospheric phenomena like thunder and lightning.

#### Sedimentary Cycle
- reservoir is the Earth's crust.

**Phosphorus cycle**

**Calcium cycle**

## Ecological Succession
- It is a process of through which an ecosystem develops and stabilises. It changes the species structure of an ecolocial over a time from a pioneer community to climax community.  
- *one community replaces other* until stabilisation.
-   leads to establishment of stable **climax community** ie last stage of succession.
- the intermediate community is called seral communities.
-   first plant to colonise an area called **pioneer community**
-   stage leading to the climax community are called *successional stages or seres*. 

**Various stages of Ecological succession**
1. **Nudation** : dev of bare area without any form of life caused due to factors such as volcanic eruption, floods, erosion, earthquake, forest fire.
2. **Invasion** : is the successful establishment of species in a barren area this could be brought about by air, water etc. The adjustment of these species is called as ecesis. Their reproduction and inc in numbers is called aggregation.
3.  **Competition and Coaction** : Compete with other organism for food, space and other resource.
4. **Reaction** : Modification of environment through influence of living organism is called reaction.
5. **Stabilisation** : last stage where climax or final community becomes stable.

**Characterstics of climax community**
-   Increased productivity. Productivity means the rate of generation of biomass in an ecosystem and expressed in gm/sq mtr. Productivity of autotrophs is called primary productivity and for heterotrophs it is called secondary productivity. 
-   shift of nutrients from the reservoirs.
-   increased diversity of organisms - niche development.
-   inc in complexity of food web.

### Primary succession 
- Takes place in a barren areas never having any vegetation no organism ever existed. Ex Volcanic eruptions, Retreat of glaciers, landslides etc.
- in a new site takes place when few hardy pioneers species example **mosses, lichens, fungi** etc grow.
-  They die and their organic matter is buried in crevices, gaps etc and on soil where seeds etc grow leading to the development of vegetation.
-   *At end pioneer species disappear* due to condition change and invasion.

### Secondary succession 
- occurs when *mature or intermediate species in a region is destroyed* due to events like forest fire, flood, harvesting, epidemic, pest attack.
-   They are taken over by hardy harbaceous species like grasses, mosses etc. Leading to the development of a forest community over the years.
-   It *starts on an already well developed soil* and are faster vis a vis Primary succession.

### Allogenic and Autogenic succession
-   Succession that are brought about by *biotic components living in the  ecosystem* is called **Autogenic Succession**
-   Where as *succession brought by outside force or abiotic components is called allogenic* succession. Ex by volcanoes, flooding, forest fires etc.

### Autotrophic and Heterotrophic
-   Succession where *initially green plants are more are called autotrophic succession* and where animals are more is called **heterotrophic**.

----
-   Succession occurs faster in middle of large continents.
-   Net Primary Productivity = **Gross primary productivity** - **Respiration losses**
-   **Detritus** is the raw material for decomposition.
-   **Leaching** is the process by which soil soluble inorganic nutrients go down the soil horizon and precipitate as salts.
-   When humus is further degraded by microbes and release of inorganic nutrients occur this process known as **mineralisation**.
	-   This process is faster when detritus is rich in Nitrogen and water soluble substances and slower when it is rich in lignin and chitin.
-   Of the incident solar radiation less than 50 per cent of it is **photosynthetically active radiation** (PAR). Plants capture only **2-10**% of it.
-   Organisms that meet their nutrient requirement by degrading dead organic matter or detritus are called **saprotrophs**. Ex Fungi, mushrooms and bateria.
-   Each trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular time called as the **standing crop**.
	 - It is measured as the mass of living organism/ **Biomass** or number of unit in an area.
-   Pyramid of numbers and Biomass can be **both inverted and upright**. Pyramid of energy is **always upright can never be inverted**.
-   The entire sequence of communities that successively change in a given area are called **sere(s)**.
-   The amount of nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, etc., present in the soil at any given time, is referred to as the **standing state**.
