- continuously replenished, less emission, available locally
- most are non polluting except biomass
- Primary source are renewable energy viz solar, wind etc. Secondary are non-renewable gen through conversion of coal, oil, natural gas

### Solar Energy
2 ways to produce is either through 
1. **Photovoltaic cell** which have 2 semi conductors np or pn type 
2. **Solar-Thermal** electricity which focuses sunlight to heat a surface containing liquid and generating electricity

#### Solar Energy in India
- states with high solar radiation are RAJ-Guj region, Ladakh, AP, Maha, MP
- [[3. Infrastructure, Liberalisation, Land Reforms in India#Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission | National Solar Mission]]
- IN installed capacity is 54GW (March 2022)
- **National Institute of Solar Energy NISE** is apex R&D institution in Solar energy field under MNRE.

##### International Solar Alliance (ISA) #body #important 
- was ==launched at the CoP**21** of UNFCC in Paris== 2015.
- Treaty based Intergov org for countries that are lying fully or partially between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. Treaty was signed at Marrakesh, Morocco.
 - Secretariat at Gurgaon
 - Objective is to drive demand, force prices down, standardise solar tech, to foster R&D.
 - 124 countries are mem
 - President of ISA Assembly is MNRE minister.
 
 Various Programs launched under this are
  1. Awards such as Vishvesvaraya, Kalpana Chawala and Diwakar.
  2. ISA CARES to solarise one primary health care
  3. ISA Technical fund implemented along w/ ADB
  4. ISA, India and World Bank tripartite agreement for One Sun, One World and One Grid Initiative.
![[4.3 International Bodies, their structure, mandate etc#^91f4ac]]
- Coalition for Sustainable Climate Action was launched comprising of global public and private corporates.

#####  Luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) 
![[video-diversi-usi-lsc.jpg.rend.500.500.jpg|500]]
 - device that uses a thin sheet of material to trap solar radiation over a large area and then directs it to cells mounted on the thin edges of the material layer.
 - they are made up of polymethylmethacrylate PMMA and doped with luminescent agents like organic dyes, quantum dots etc.
 - used to replace solar cells since it is cheap, effective in clouder climates, can collect and diffuse solar radiation, broad absorption range, long term stability 

#### IRENA International Renewable Energy Agency #body #important 
- has 150 member nations with Headquarters in **Abu Dhabi** 
- is an **intergovernmental** organisation
- promotes all type of renewable energy 
![[Prelims Facts 2 March 2020-March 2021#^cfc24f]]


### Wind Energy
- Total installed capacity of 40GW, 4th largest in World
- Wind farms are either onshore or offshore (more expensive)
- Variables that determine wind electricity gen are speed, blade radius and air density
- 2 types of designs are Horizontal axis design (commonly used) and Vertical 
![[3. Infrastructure, Liberalisation, Land Reforms in India#^8b6ab3]]
-  National Wind Energy Mission was proposed
-  MNRE has set target of 60GW by 2022

### Hydro Power
-  cheapest most cleanest but env issues associated w/ it
-  Small hydro : installed capacity of less than **25** MW, 5400 such sites in India
 
####  3 types of hydropower facilities:
-   **Impoundment** : uses a dam to store river water in a reservoir
-   **Diversion** : a portion of a river is diverted to low through a turbine, may not require a dam.
-   **Pumped storage** : it acts as a battery, when demand is low it pumps water from lower reservoir to upper and during high demands viceversa
 

###  Ocean Thermal Energy

![[Offshore_OTEC_Diagram_900x489-1.png]]

####  Wave energy 
- is transfer of energy from the **wind** to the sea.
- first wave energy, project with a capacity of 150MW, has been set up at Vizhinjam near Trivandrum
 
####  Tidal Energy
- extracted from tides by creating a reservoir or basin behind a barrage and passing tidal waters through turbines
-   major tidal energy project was proposed to be set up in **Hanthal Creek** in Gulf of Kutchh
 
###  Biomass
 - derived from carbonaceous human and natural wastes
 - #concept Biomass does not add CO2 to the atmosphere as it absorbs the same amt of Carbon while growing as it releases when consume
 - In has set target of 10GW by 2022, Total installed capacity is 10GW
 - Incentive schemes have been introduced for cultivation of **Jatropha**
 - Central Finance Assistance CFA by MNRE to Biomass projects
 
#### Process that convert biomass to useful products #important 

##### Gassification
- directly burned ==in the presence of excess air at high temp==
- gas produced during gasification is known as **producer** gas which is a mixture of carbon monoxide (25%), hydrogen and hydrocarbons (15%), and carbon dioxide and nitrogen (60%)

#####  Pyrolysis
 - Decomposition of organic matter by heating it in absence of air
 - ==gas given out is called Syngas==
 - Typically syngas is 30 to 60% carbon monoxide (CO), 25 to 30% hydrogen (H2), 0 to 5% methane (CH4), 5 to 15% carbon dioxide (CO2), also some traces of water vapour and sulphur compounds.
 
#####  Anaerobic Digestion/ Biomethanation/ Methanogenesis
- is a scientific process whereby microorganisms in an **anaerobic** environment decompose biodegradable matter and produce rich biogas and effluent
- Hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis are 3 process that take place sequentially

##### Cogeneration
 -  one type of energy must always be **heat** and other may be electricity or mechanical energy
 -  Ex steam generated from boilers of power plants are used to run turbines to produce electricity
 -  saves cost, primary usage in sugar, rice, mills, distilleries, steel, chemical, cement plants etc  
 -  Bagasse cogeneration states are AP, TN, Ktaka, Maha, UP

### Waste to Energy
- potential to divert waste from landfills
- estimated potential of 225MW from all sewage
-  total installed capacity is 100MW

#### Major Constraints
- Tech needs to be imported, cost of setting such projects is high
- segregation at source facilities are few in India along w/ low level compliance of  [[Acts and Policies#Solid Waste Management Rules SWM 2016| Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules]].
- Lack of policy support.

### Geothermal Energy
-  harness energy stored in Eath's inner ore which comes out at certain places on the Crust 
-  where a higher geothermal gradient is created which is inc in temp with depth
-  Hydrothermal convection is most common way of capturing
-  In has a potential of 10GW in regions such as Himalayas, Lushai-Naga region, Andaman and Nicobar, Cambay, Son Narmada, Damodar Valley, Puga Velley etc
-  Plan to set up geothermal plant in Ladakh

### Fuel Cell
- Fuel cells generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction but not combustion. H2 and O2 are combined to generate electricity and water.  
- Convert chem energy to electrical (DC) 
-  H2 used because no pollution from it
- can be used for small scale decentralised power generation

### REN21 #body 
- is the global renewable energy **multi-stakeholder** network 
- connects wide range of key actors from Govt, international orgs etc
- **non-profit association**, provides policy relevant infor, platform for interconnection b/w stakeholders
