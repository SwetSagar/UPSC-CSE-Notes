## Heat Wave
- IMD criterai for decl is 40°C for plains and 37°C for coastal areas 30° for Hilly areas
- Dec when departure from normal temp is 4.5-6.4° C
- Severe when > 6.4° C
- For plains heatwave is considered based on actual max temp >45 and severe > 47C 
-   Period of abnormally high tem, occur b/w March June
###   Causes
-   Hot winds blowing from deserts, anticyclone formation, rising global temp, shift in air current/weather pattern, depletion of Ozone layer, Jet stream
-   High temp 9 degress, humidity, duration of 5 days min, lack of moisture
-   concrete and paved surfaces show magnified effect, Urban heat islands, high intensity of UV rays

###   Impact
-   Heat stroke, exhaustion, cramps, dehydration, nausea, dizziness, headaches, lead to D,

###   Mitigation
-   4 imp criteria forecasting, build capacity, community outreach, inter agency coop, build green cover, estd cooling centres, Public awareness, protect environment
-   Id heat hot spots and implement local Heat action plans, inter agency coordination
-   promote traditional adaptation practices, policy intervention and adaptation across sectors
-   simple design features in houses

###   Challenges
-   Lack of research, narrow analysis, of urban ward level data, less active usage of public message delivery, lack of Public awareness, half-hearted attempts


## Cold Waves 
- IMD declares cold wave when min temp is equal or less than 10deg Celsius at weather stations  4.5deg - 6.4deg below normal temp in the plains.  
-   Very cold air over large area, preceded by weather events, blizzards or ice storms
-   Associated w/ EL Nino, cyclones, Jet Streams, western disturbances, cold wave risks
-   Distribution pattern
    -   DEC JAN in PUN, HAR, RAJ; snowfall in Himalayas, cold winds from Caspian sea
-   Impact - damage to agriculture, roads, hypothermia etc


**Reasons for Cold wave In India**
- Lack of western disturbance which bring down temp during day due to precipitation and keep night temp steady.
- Snowfall in Upper Himalayas
- Downward subsidence of cold air over north India from upper Himalayas bring down temp
- La Nina conditions favors cold wave.

**Impact of cold wave conditions**
- CW creates wider day and night temp impacting agricultural practices in Rabi season.
- Would affect the productivity of cash crops ex coffee.
- Increases incidence of diseases.

**Mitigation**
-   Location specific measures, light irrigation to farmers per need, convert schools etc to shelters, promote outreach
-   Lack of preparation, preparedness, community participation
