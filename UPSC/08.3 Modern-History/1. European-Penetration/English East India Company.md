## Analysis
### Proponenents of the Sub-imperialism theory
-   There was No overt mandate given by the British parliament for conquest/ colonisation
  
```ad-Views
collapse: open
- **PJ Marshall** : ==until 1784 there was no conscious or consistent B policy for political conquest==, neither planned nor directed by B, initiative of coy officials aka **sub imperialism**
-   **CA Bayly** : expansion was ==primarily motivated by fiscal and military needs== of coy
```


### Why the sub imperialism theory is not entirely correct?

   - Contrary views : use of force from very beginning esp during Charles II; use Navy in IN ocean
   - **Phillip Lawson** : ==moral economy of B gunnery in local markets prevented IN rulers from obstructing B trade==
   - 1660 **Cromwell silver plates** given to king, 1661 loan many loans given
   - Initial system of Presidency sys, Bombay as dowry, shift hq form Surat to Bombay(1687) treaty of Whitehall, mutual defence pact also there
   - New company formed when promoters of it gave 2mil pound, ==right to trade became marketable community== 
   - 1770s coy promised annual 400,000 state exchequer for IN territorial possessions
   - Charters of coy provided delegated sovereignty
   - **PJ Cain and AG Hopkins** expansion was ==exentsion of gentlemanly capitalism==
   - rights of Interlopers/ illegal trade upheld in **Skinner vs EIC case** validated the misuse of dastaks


## Economic, Geographic, Administrative advantage of EIC [^1] 
- [x]   #todo 
- EIC was formed as joint stock company that allowed it to mobilise a large amount of capital from its stockholders. It also ensured continuity of business activities and policies over a longer period with a scope for mobility of capital. 
- It was given a monopoly by the govt of England with trade in India and other countries first given by Queen Elizabeth I this was done by granting a charter to the Company.
- Other European East India Companies were marginalised through military and political victories of Britain over them.
- Weakness of successor states and principalities since the decline of Mughal Empire allowed EIC to bully and bribe local powers to grant it special privileges.
- Coercive practices of the company towards the farmers helped it maintain cheaper prices at the expense of the farmers.
- Company legitimised militarisaiton in the name of self protection and protection of its trade. The English with its superior weapons and Navy was able to rout every Naval power in the region. 
- EIC being a private enterprise created sense of enthusiasm and self confidence among its people
 - British never neglected their commercial interest whereas the French subordinated their commercial interest to territorial ambition which made it short of funds. 
 - Britain had superior commanders Ex Clive, Lawrence, Eyre Coote.
 - Strategic location of Britain was much better than that of French
