-   Special session at Calcutta Sept 1920 - NCN was *approved*

##   December 1920 At the Nagpur session
-   non-cooperation was endorsed
-   Congress decided to have the **attainment of swaraj** through peaceful and legitimate means as it primary goal
-   CWC of 15 mem set up, provincial committees on linguistic basis was organised, ward committees was made and entry fee was reduced
-   Gandhi said swaraj can be ushered in 1 year if non-cooperation program was implemented.
-   Gandhiji suggested the NCN to the Khilafat committee on 9 June 1920.
-   social distress over economic condition, higher prices, shortage of food, draughts and epidemics
-   launched in August 1920
-   Program included surrender of titles and honours, boycott of gov affiliated schools and colleges, law courts, foreign cloth and resignation from gov service as well as non-payment of taxes
-   extra constitutional mass action, **revolutionary terrorists** also supported the movt
-   Educational boycott was very successful in Bengal. Lawyers gave up their practice viz CR Das, Motilal Nehru, Kitchlew, Patel etc
-   Boycott of foreign clothes, picketing of toddy and foreign cloth shops
-   NCN slowly started to turn violent first during the visit of Prince of Wales in Bombay and later in Chauri Chaura
-   The **Gandhi Reading talk** was held to diffuse tensions. #important 
-   Gandhiji announced that mass civil disobedience shall be held from Bardoli was withdrawn on 12 Feb 1922 -> Chauri Chaura Happened.
-   withdrawal is seen as a consequence to the radicalisation of the masses. Some say that it was to protect the propertied class.
-   was done to curb repression which would have been intense after the Chauri Chaura incident.
 
## Analysis from Sekhar Bandyopadhyay
-   Provided for surrender titles, boycott schools, courts, councils, boycott foreign goods, encourage national schools, arbitration courts and khadi
-   Opposition from CR Das(later endorsed), Jinnah, Pal
-   Also radical restructuring of INC - make it true mass org
-   **Judith B** : Nagpur session was victory of MG
-   **Rajat Ray + Richard Gordon** : MG capitulated to CR Das
-   Support form M Khilafatists, backward classes
-   Trade unionism, labour unrest
-   Began 1921 emphasis middle class participation
-   **Tilak Swaraj Fund**
-   1st violence in Bombay thus full scale CDM postponed
-   Experimental no rev campaign at Bardoli in Guj
-   Except Madras council election boycotted elsewhere.
-   Economic boycott successful
-   Middle class part not spectacular
-   Marwari, Gujarati remained Pro Nationalist, large industrialist pro-gov
-   Uneven geo spread and wide regional variation
    -   Peasant part in Rajasthan, Sindh, Gujarat, Awadh, Assam, Maha, Ktaka unaffected
    -   Lower caste part in Madras, Maha
    -   Tribal in Andhra, Bengal, Assam
-   Madras Justice party launched non Brahman movt against Brahman dominated INC.
	- It was formed in 1916 by TN Nair, P Tyagaraja, CN Mudaliar. Its initial demands were for reserved seats in Provincial Legislative Council that slowly extended to reservation in education, public appointments and nomination to local bodies.
-   National schools, arb courts and Khadi (expensive) did not succeed everywhere.
-   Akali Movt, Singh Sabha movt, SGPC, Jathas.
-   Most effect in UP -> Baba Ramchandra, UP Kisan Sabha
-   North Bihar -> Swami Viswananada, Kisan Sabha
-   Midnapur Bengal -> Mahisya peasants leader BN Sasmal
-   Patidar in Gujarat
-   Cross caste mobil Awadh, militant
-   Hill areas of Kumaun, Garhwal
    -   **Richard Tucker** : political conflict reaching hills for 1st time. Incendiarism shows that it had little connection w/ formal Cong movt
-   New meaning which depended on specific structure of society
