## The Thesis
-   myth is that the Indian National Congress was started by A.O. Hume and others under the official direction, guidance of Lord Dufferin to provide a **safe, mild, peaceful, and constitutional outlet or safety valve** for the rising discontent among the masses.
-   Core was that violent revolution was on the cards and could be avoided only by the Congress.
-   **Lala Lajpat Rai** used it to attack the Moderates within the Congress through its Young India book that he published in 1916.
-   **R Palme Dutt's** work India Today wrote that it was secretly organised with through a plan by the Viceroy. A/c to him Congress lead the masses in the national struggle but betrayed them when they moved towards a revolutionary path.
-   RSS chief **Golwalkar** has criticised using this that INC has stifled true nationalism.
-   Liberals CF Andrews and Girija Mukherji accepted the this theory because it helped avoid useless bloodshed.
-   was 1st mentioned in William Wedderburn's biography of AO Hume in 1913 who sourced it from undated memorandum in Hume's paper dealing with the foundation of INC.
-   memorandum slowly became government reports, secret report from the CID, he received in his official capacity but the reports were nowhere to be found in the National Archives.


## Clues against these assumptions 
-   Hume worked in Do Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce. How could he get Home Dept files or CID reports.
-   was in Shimla and the files were kept in Delhi.
-   Some have said that 30,000 reporters had said that there was discontent among the peasants. But state employed only more than a few hundred.
-   meeting was held in 1878 b/w Hume and Dufferin. Why did they wait for 7 years to found INC.
-   Wedderburn writes that Hume got that the warning was received from various religious leaders who got this information from their Chelas.
-   The impression given by him was that these Gurus had supernatural occult powers.
-   Dufferin was critical of Hume and his organisation of a Political party on the line of Irish one to bring the opinions of the Natives to the fray.
