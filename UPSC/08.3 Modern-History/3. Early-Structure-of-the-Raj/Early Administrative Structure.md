 ![[#1793]]
 
 ![[#Police]]

###  Revenue reforms : 
- Reorganised rev dept in 1787. Bengal divided into fiscal areas placed under a Collector.
- Committee of Rev constituted under WH was rename as Board of Rev and charged w/ superintending Collectors
- [[Permanent Settlement]]

### Commercial Reforms 
- Before this Board of Trade at Calcutta estd in 1774, EIC procured goods for EU and IN contractors. They took high prices and gave inferior goods. Corruption was rampant.
- Cornwalis reduced strength of Board of Trade for 11 to 5. 
- Good were now to be bought from Commercial Residents and Agents who made advances to manufacturers and settled prices w/ them. 

### Other Reforms
- Forbade EIC employees from accepting bribes/ presents/ private trade. They were to declare their property under oath before leaving IN. 
- Inc salaries of officials ex Collector to get Rs1500/month and 1% of total rev collected.
- Had low opinion of Indian character, ability and integrity.  Sought higher offices be reserved for EU. 
- Covenanted services were closed to Indian. In army they could not rise above Subedars and in civil service above Munsiffs, Sadr Amins or Deputy Collectors. 

### Estimate of Cornwallis
- Lucky to have assistants like John Shore, James Grant, George Barlow etc.
- wanted anglicisaiton of Indians to solve its problems but his Europeanisation of covenanted services denied IN people their share.


```ad-Views

**Aspinal** :  possessed many qualities of mind and hear which inspired confidence in others. 

**Gleig** : wanted to make everything as English as possible in country that resembles England in nothing.

**WS Seton Karr** : He may not be on the same platform as Wellesley or Dalhousie but in constructive ability and in tenacity of purpose he may challenge with some of the most eminent men who ahve rule India.

**LM Penson** : Was upright and honest and did not fear sudden decline in favour. C was public servant who upheld national and not private traditions.
