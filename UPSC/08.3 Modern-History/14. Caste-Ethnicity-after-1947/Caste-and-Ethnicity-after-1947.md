Tribes in post-colonial electoral politics

1. "Nehru favored the policy of integrating the tribal people in Indian society, of making
them as integral part of the Indian nation even while maintaining their distinct identity and
culture." -Elaborate with special reference to Northeastern India. [2012, 30m]

```ad-Answer

Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, believed in the policy of integrating the tribal people in Indian society, while maintaining their distinct identity and culture. Nehru believed that the tribal communities, particularly in Northeastern India, were an integral part of the Indian nation, and that their integration was essential for the development and progress of the country.

To achieve this goal, Nehru implemented several policies and measures aimed at integrating the tribal communities in Northeastern India with the mainstream society. These policies included:

2.  The establishment of the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) in 1954, which aimed to promote the development of the tribal communities in Northeastern India, and to preserve their culture and traditions.
    
4.  Nehru also encouraged the study of the languages, culture and customs of the tribal people, and supported the formation of organizations such as the Anthropological Survey of India (ASI) and the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) to promote the research and preservation of the cultural heritage of the tribal communities.
    
5.  Nehru also supported the development of education among the tribal people, through the establishment of institutions such as the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) and the establishment of a number of schools and colleges in the region.
    
6.  The government of India also provided financial assistance and scholarships to the tribal students to pursue higher education, and encouraged them to participate in the mainstream society.

While Nehru's policies and measures aimed at integrating the tribal communities of Northeastern India with the mainstream society, they also aimed to preserve their culture and identity, and to prevent them from being assimilated. Nehru's policies helped to promote the development of the tribal communities in Northeastern India, and to preserve their distinct cultural heritage and identity.
