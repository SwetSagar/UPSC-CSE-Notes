1. Assess the role of the Left Wing within the Indian National Congress between 1920 and 1947. [1981, 60m]

```ad-Answer

The Left Wing of the Indian National Congress played a significant role in the struggle for independence in India between 1920 and 1947. The Left Wing of the Indian National Congress was a group of radical members of the party who advocated for more extreme measures to be taken in order to achieve freedom from British rule. The Left Wing was led by prominent figures such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Maulana Azad.

The Left Wing of the Indian National Congress was instrumental in pushing the party to adopt more militant tactics in the fight for independence. It was a strong advocate of civil disobedience and mass protests against British rule. They called for the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920, which saw millions of Indians boycotting British goods and services. The Left Wing also supported the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930, which saw thousands of Indians engaging in acts of civil disobedience.

They were also a strong proponent of socialism and was heavily involved in the formation of the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC). They supported the rights of workers and was instrumental in pushing for the implementation of labour laws and other measures to protect the rights of workers in India.

Were heavily involved in the Quit India Movement of 1942. The Left Wing also supported the formation of the Indian National Army, which was led by Subhas Chandra Bose and fought against the British forces in World War II.

2. Account for the rise and growth of Left-wing within the Congress. Did Jawaharlal Nehru believe in a socialistic approach to Indian and world problems and if so why? [1986, 60m]

```ad-Answer

The rise and growth of Left-wing within the Congress can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, the Indian National Congress (INC) had always been a broad-based organization, with members representing a variety of political ideologies. As the INC gained more prominence and influence in Indian politics, it became increasingly attractive to those with left-wing views.

The growth of the Left-wing within the Congress was also fuelled by the emergence of the CSP (INS) in the 1930s. The INS was a left-wing political party that sought to promote socialist ideals in India. 

The rise of Jawaharlal Nehru to the leadership of the INC also played an important role in the growth of the Left-wing within the party. Nehru was an advocate of socialism and he sought to implement many of its principles in India. He was an ardent supporter of public ownership and nationalization of key industries, and he also sought to promote social and economic justice.

Nehru also believed in a socialistic approach to Indian and world problems. He was a strong believer in internationalism and he sought to promote cooperation between countries in order to solve global issues. He also sought to promote peace and disarmament as a means of preventing war.

Nehru was also an advocate of economic planning, and he believed that the government should play an active role in the economy in order to ensure that resources are allocated efficiently. He also sought to promote social welfare and education as a means of improving the quality of life for all Indians.

Overall, the rise and growth of Left-wing within the Congress can be attributed to a number of factors. The emergence of CSP, the influence of Subhas Chandra Bose, and the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru all played a role in bringing more left-wingers into the party. Nehru's socialistic approach to Indian and world problems was also influential in shaping the INC's policies and objectives.

3. 'The National Movement has shown concern for problems other than the constitutional one.' Discuss the factors that helped the rise of a left wing in the Indian National Congress.  
[1990, 60m]

```ad-Answer

The rise of a left wing in the Indian National Congress can be attributed to various factors.

Firstly, the National Movement was increasingly becoming aware of the socio-economic problems faced by the Indian people, such as poverty, illiteracy and inequality. This led to a shift in the focus of the movement from constitutional issues to socio-economic issues. 

Secondly, the idea of socialism was gaining traction in the country, with the formation of the Indian Socialist Party in 1934 and the emergence of leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, who advocated for a more radical approach to the freedom struggle. 

Thirdly, the emergence of the peasant and labour movements across the country added to the pressure on the Indian National Congress to take a more progressive stance on socio-economic issues. 

Finally, the growing influence of the Soviet Union and the success of its socialist model provided a source of inspiration for the left wing of the Congress.

Labor rights: Left wing members of the INC have been vocal advocates for the rights of workers and labor unions, and have pushed for policies that support and protect these groups.
    
Decolonization and anti-imperialism: The rise of left wing within the INC was also driven by the desire to end colonial rule and imperialism, and to promote self-determination and autonomy for India and other colonized nations.

4. Account for the rise and growth of leftism in the Congress movement. What impact did it have on contemporary Indian politics? [1997, 60m]

```ad-Answer

The rise of the Left wing in the Indian National Congress in the period of 1920-1947 had a significant impact on the contemporary politics of India. This period saw the emergence of a strong Leftist ideology in the Congress and the rise of a powerful Left-wing in the party, which was led by prominent figures such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.

The first impact of the rise of Left wing in the Congress was the emergence of a more progressive and secular ideology in the party. The Congress was no longer dominated by conservative and elitist forces, but instead embraced a more inclusive and progressive ideology that sought to bring about social and economic reforms. This was evident in the adoption of the Nehru Report in 1928, which sought to bring about greater social and economic equality in India.

The second impact was the adoption of a more radical approach to the struggle for independence. The emergence of the Left-wing in the Congress led to the adoption of more militant tactics such as the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement. This was in stark contrast to the earlier more moderate approach of the Congress, which had sought to negotiate with the British for independence.

The third impact was the emergence of the idea of a united India. The Left-wing in the Congress sought to unite all the different communities and castes in India under one banner and this was evident in the adoption of the Purna Swaraj Declaration in 1929. This declaration sought to bring about a unified and independent India, free from British rule.

The fourth impact was the emergence of the concept of socialism in India. The Left-wing in the Congress was strongly influenced by the ideas of socialism and this was evident in the adoption of the Karachi Resolution in 1931. This resolution sought to bring about a socialist society in India, characterized by social and economic equality.

The fifth impact was the emergence of the idea of non-alignment. The Left-wing in the Congress was strongly opposed to the idea of aligning India with either the Western powers or the Soviet Union, and instead sought to remain independent and non-aligned. This was evident in the adoption of the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954, which sought to promote peaceful co-existence between India and its neighbors.

The sixth impact was the emergence of the idea of a welfare state. The Left-wing in the Congress sought to bring about a more equitable society in India and this was evident in the adoption of the Five Year Plans in 1951. These plans sought to bring about economic and social reforms in India and promote the idea of a welfare state.

The seventh impact was the adoption of a more assertive foreign policy. The Left-wing in the Congress sought to promote India’s interests in the international arena, and this was evident in the adoption of the Panchsheel Agreement, which sought to promote peaceful co-existence between India and its neighbors.

In conclusion, the rise of the Left-wing in the Congress in the period of 1920-1947 had a significant impact on the contemporary politics of India. This period saw the emergence of a more progressive and secular ideology in the Congress, the adoption of a more radical approach to the struggle for independence, the emergence of the idea of a united India, the emergence of the concept of socialism in India, the emergence of the idea of non-alignment, the emergence of the idea of a welfare state, and the adoption of a more assertive foreign policy. All of these changes had a lasting impact on the contemporary politics of India.

5. Discuss the nature of the leadership and programme of the Congress Socialist party.[2002, 60m])

```ad-Answer

The party's leadership was composed of individuals who were committed to socialism and believed that the INC needed to adopt a more progressive and left-wing stance in order to address the economic and social issues facing India.

The CSP's program emphasized the need for radical economic and social reforms to address poverty and inequality. They called for the nationalization of key industries, the redistribution of land, and the protection of workers' rights. They also advocated for the empowerment of marginalized groups, such as Dalits, Adivasis and Minorities, and pushed for policies that promoted their rights and welfare.

The CSP's leadership was composed of prominent figures such as Jayaprakash Narayan, Minoo Masani, and Ram Manohar Lohia, who were all influential figures in the Indian independence movement and later in Indian politics. They were also associated with the socialist and communist movements of the time.

In terms of its organizational structure, the CSP was a loosely organized group within the larger Congress Party, which allowed its members to continue to participate in the activities of the parent party while also advocating for a more socialist agenda. The party was dissolved in 1948, as the majority of its leaders joined the newly formed Praja Socialist Party, but the ideas and ideology of CSP continued to influence the Indian politics in the following years.

```ad-Answer

The Congress Socialist Party (CSP) played a significant role in influencing the program and policy of the Indian National Congress (INC) during the 1930s and 1940s. The CSP's emphasis on socialism and progressive economic policies, as well as on the empowerment of marginalized groups, had a significant impact on the Congress's policies in these areas.

One of the most notable examples of the CSP's influence on Congress's policy was the passing of the economic policy resolution in 1944, which was heavily influenced by the CSP's socialist and progressive economic agenda. This resolution advocated for the nationalization of key industries, the redistribution of land, and the protection of workers' rights.

The CSP also played a significant role in shaping the election manifesto of the Congress, which reflected the party's socialist and progressive economic agenda. The CSP's ideas and ideologies also influenced the formation of the National Planning Committee, which was established to develop a comprehensive economic plan for India.

The CSP also played a key role in the formation of several other organizations, such as the All India Student's Federation and Progressive Writers Association. These organizations were established to promote progressive and socialist ideals among the youth and the literary community respectively.

In terms of social policies, the CSP's emphasis on the empowerment of marginalized groups, such as Dalits, Adivasis and Minorities, had a significant impact on the Congress's policies in these areas. The Congress began to adopt more inclusive and equitable policies that aimed to address the needs of these groups.

Overall, the Congress Socialist Party played an important role in shaping the Congress's program and policy during the 1930s and 1940s. The CSP's socialist and progressive economic agenda, as well as its emphasis on the empowerment of marginalized groups, had a significant impact on the Congress's policies in these areas.
