-   In 1929 the gov tried to curb the trade union movements by arresting various communists leaders called the Meerut Conspiracy case.
-   This led to a dearth of left leadership and coupled with the sectarian politics away from nationalist congress agenda made them very weak.
-   The CPI was declared illegal in 1934.
