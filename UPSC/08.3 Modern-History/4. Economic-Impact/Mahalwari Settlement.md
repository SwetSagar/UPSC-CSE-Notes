-   29% of cultivable land under it
-   Modified form of Zamindari introduced in ==Gangetic plains, North West Provinces, Central India and Punjab==.
- &  Settlement was made to be **village by village with landlords or heads of the family**.
-   **Metcalfe** + **Maine** early proponents
-   Taluqdars per Nurul Hasan were 'intermediary Zamindars'
-   Primary Zamindars had proprietary + habitational rights, included small owner cultivators
-   Initially collected from local lineage dominated ruler and Mughal Jagirdars
-   High rents resisted, earlier taluqdars liquidated -> new social class banker, moneylenders etc bcame new land owning class/ non cultivating
-   Shift taluqdar -> Primary Zamindars
-   Why was it brought ? 
	- Check oppressive nature of taluq, protect peasant rights, improve agri, get high rev
-   Problems : 
	- Survey too complicated, over assessment, agri depression 1828, arrears, diff find buyers
-   Regulation XI 1833 - RM bird
	-   Assess rev of entire mahal/ fiscal unit base on net value of potential produce, state share 2/3 for 30 yr
	-   Flattened whole surface of society many taluq were removed
