Nationalisation of banks in 1969 14 private banks, six in 1980.

## Why?
- Large share of non- institutional sources eg landlords, 
- traders and moneylenders failed to meet the credit needs of the rural areas; 

## Policy after 1969 
- new branch licensing policy -> branches had to be opened in unbanked rural areas 
- priority-sector lending was introduced : whereby 40% set aside credit for agriculture, MSME, housing etc, 
- differential interest rate scheme for the weakest sections, 
- Lead Bank scheme : a district was assigned to one bank 
- RRBs estd in 1975 to enlarge the supply of institutional credit 
- (NABARD) in 1982 to regulate cooperative banks and RRBs 

## Outcomes: 
- outstanding debt of rural households increased 
- growth of financial intermediation, bank deposits, gross savings rate rose, gross investment rate rose, 
- demonstrated the utility of monetary policy in furthering redistributionist goals 

## Post 1991 Narasimham Committee : 
- monetary policy should be divorced from redistributionist goals. 
- banks should be free to practise commercial modes viz profitability as the primary goal, open and close branches as they desired 
- Priority sector guidelines were diluted, rate regulations were removed 

### Impacts: 
- branches closed 
- growth of agricultural credit fell 
- total outstanding debt of rural households fell post; 
- 2004 policy to double the flow of agricultural credit within three years 
- new branch authorisation policy, 
- Permission if RBI was satisfied that bank would serve underbanked areas 
- By 2011 mandated that at least 25% of new branches located in unbanked centres 

### Challenges: 
- encouraged public banks to lend more for retail and personal loans, 
- high-risk sectors banks funded by short-term deposit liabilities were taking on exposures that involved long-term risks 
- rising non-performing assets 
- fear of fiscal deficits
