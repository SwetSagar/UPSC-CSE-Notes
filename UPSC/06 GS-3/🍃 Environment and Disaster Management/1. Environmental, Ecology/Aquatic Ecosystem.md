They are ecosystem that is surrounded by a body of water. The 2 main types of Ecosystem are Marine and Fresh water.

Aquatic Ecosystems based on salt content have 3 types : ^4b58e5
-   **Fresh** Water ecosystem very low  5 ppt.
-   **Marine** Ecosys have  35 ppt
-   **Brackish** water ecosys contain b/w 5-35 ppt. eg salt marshes, mangrooves swamps.
- ocean currently has a pH around **8.0**. #important 


## 1. Marine Ecosystem

### Aquatic Organisms

Q. Aquatic **Organisms** that are unattached and live at the air water interface such as floating plants, etc 

A. **Neuston**. ![](Aquatic-Ecosystem-image1-00101903.jpg)

Q. Aquatic organisms which remain **attached to stems and leaves of rooted plants** or substances emerging above the bottom mud such as sessile algae  

A. **Periphyton**. ![](Aquatic-Ecosystem-image2-00101903.jpg)


Q. This group contains both microscopic plants like algae and animals like crustaceans and protozoans. Not found in moving waters eg 

A. **Planktons**. ![](Aquatic-Ecosystem-image3-00101903.jpg)


Q. This group contains **animals which are swimmers**. They are large and powerful and can overcome water currents are?

A. **Nekton**


- **Benthos** are found deep in the botton of water mass

The Factors that *limit the productivity of aquatic habitats* is :

-   **Photic Zone** : extends below to the level where the light level is **1**% of that of surface
-   **Aphotic Zone** : only respiration takes place here *aka profundal zone*
-   **Dissolved Oxygen** : depends on air-water interface and photosynthesis and temperature. O2 is less soluble in warm water. Below 3-5ppm organisms start to dies
-   **Transparency** : affects light penetration. Clay, silt, phytoplankton affect transparency.
-   **Temperature** : aquatic animals have narrow temp tolerance limit.


### Estuary Ecosystem 
![[Estuarine-food-web20160719-7591-1aisej5.jpg | 500]]
-   flow of **freshwater** from river mixes with **salt water** from the ocean.
-   are the most productive  water bodies in the world

###### Characterstics 
-   semi enclosed coastal body, has free connection with open sea.
-   salinity ranges from 0-35ppt, have very little wave action.
-   receives very high amount of nutrients from fresh and marine water
-   most heavily populated areas are located here.

###### Formation 
-   rising sea level
-   movement of sand and sandbars
-   glacial processes
-   tectonic processes
-   Examples are bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets etc.
-   salinity and amount of flooding affect life here.
-   Unique animals like sea lions, sea catfish, saltworts, eelgrass, saltgrasses etc are found here.
-   India has 14 major river estuaries most of which are located in the east coast.
 
###### Issues of Indian Estuarine Ecosystem 

-   Water flow is either in excess or very low.
-   Modification of estuarine catchment
-   Pollution, recreation and tourism
-   Ports and shipping
-   Urbanization, mining, agriculture
-   Commercial fishing, over exploitation
-   submergence of catchment area.


### Mangrooves 
-   characteristic **littoral** plant formation of tropical and subtropical **sheltered** coastlines
-   Mangroves are trees and bushes growing below the high water level of spring tides.

###### Characteristics :

-   Are evergreen land plants, grow on sheltered shore viz tidal flats, deltas, estuaries, creeks, bays and barrier islands.
-   adapted to high salinty and anaerobic respiration → through pnuematophores.
-   Rhizophoras have arching prop roots, while Avicennia have vertical pneumatophores.
-   exhibit viviparity reproduction ie seeds germinate in the tree itself.
-   Excess salt is either excreted through leaves or is blocked through roots.
-   They are located in Sunderbans, Mahanadi, Krishna-Godavari, Cauvery, Goa, Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Andaman and Nicobar.
 
###### Role of Mangrooves
-   Enhance deposition of sediments in the area
-   reduce inundation of coastal lowlands
-   prevents coastal soil erosion
-   protects from tsunami, hurricanes etc
-   Enhance natural recycling of nutrients, support flora and fauna, env for breeding, supplies wood etc.


### Coral Reefs
-   living animals and have a symbiotic relationship with 'zooxanthellae' microscopic algae which live on corals → assist in nutrient production by providing **carbon compounds**, also give them **colours**.
-   are 2 types hard corals and soft corals. ==Only hard corals build reefs==. ==Polyps are coral reef builders==.
-   Various shapes associated with them are table like, branched, cups like, boulders etc.
-   Majority are found in tropical and sub-tropical water but they are also found in deep water in colder regions. Largest cold water reef is **Rost Reef of Norway**.
 

##### Features :
-   Occur in **shallow tropical areas** where water is clean, clear and warm.
-   most productive and complex coastal ecosystems
-   corals are slow growing zooxanthallae are fast growing.
-   they help in recycling of scarce nutrients.
 

##### Classification 
![[Pasted image 20220303070349.png]]
-   depending on their location they are 
	- **fringing** → contiguous to the shore and are most common type eg Andaman
	- **patch** → Ex palk bay, Mannar; 
	- **barrier** → parallel to the coastlines separated by lagoons eg Nicobar and 
	- **atoll** → circular or semi circular Ex Lakshadweep.
-   protect against storm surges and erosion, capture nutrients, largest biogenic Calcium carbonate producer, provides substrates to mangrooves, habitat to flora and fauna.


##### Bleaching :
-   Occurs when densities of **zooxanthellae** decline and concentration of photosynthetic pigments within them falls.
-   usually recovers within a few weeks but if it is prolonged coral host dies.

**Causes of Bleaching**
-   Temperature inc and sudden temp drops
-   Solar irradiance during summer when it is maximum.
-   Sub aerial Exposure to events like extreme low tides, sea level drops, tectonic uplift
-   Sedimentation, fresh water dilution, Inorganic nutrients.
-   **Xenobiotics** : substances that are foreign to animal life. Ex. during elevations concentrations of Cu, herbicides and oil.
-   **Epizootics** : outbreak of disease that affect many animals of the same kind. Ex pathogens that induce bleaching.

##### Mitigation Measures #important #scheme 
-   To enforce and implement the CRZ and IPZ Notifications MoEFCC has introduced **Coastal Zone Management Authorities**.
-   In addition ==Coral reef is included in Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972==.
-   National Parks, Sanctuaries and Marine Biosphere reserves have been created under the provision of WPA 1972.
[[Environmental Organisations#Wildlife Crime Control Board WCCB 2007 | WCCB]] has also been set up to strengthen law enforcement.
-   **Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System (COMAPS)** : assesses the health of coastal waters.
-   **Land Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ)** : Investigates the effects of global change on coastal zones.
-   **Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management (ICMAM)** :
-   Ganga Action Plan and National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA)

###### Namami Ganga Program #scheme : 
-   **Nirmal Dhara** : ensuring sustainable municipal sewage management, with Mo Urban Dev and
-   Nirmal Dhara with Mo **Drinking water** for rural areas
-   **Aviral Dhara** : Enforcing River Regulatory Zones on Ganga Banks
-   **NRI Ganga Fund** Clean Ganga Fund :
-   funds from residents, NRIs/PIO and others, operated through a trust.
-   Domestic donors will be eligible for tax benefits.



## 2. Fresh Water Ecosystem

### Lentic Ecosystem (Lakes) 
-   Ageing occurs due to accumulation of minerals
-   Are classified on the basis of salinity as **Freshwater**, **Brackish** or **Saline** lakes.
-   On the basis of nutrient content as Oligotrophic(low nutrient), Mesotropic(moderate nutrients) and Eutrophic(Highliy nutrient)

**Nutrients from lakes can be removed by :**
-   Flushing w/ nutrient low water
-   Deep water abstraction
-   On site removal through flocculation/flotation
-   On site algae removal by filters and P adsorbers.
-   On site algae skimming.
-   Artificial mixing/ Destratification
-   Fish harvesting
-   Sludge removal

- ==Lakes have been defined by National Lake Conservation Programme NCLP== as having min depth of **3**m and water spread of **10**ha having low or very little **vegetation**. They are less important when compared to wetland.
- But 'Urban Lakes' has no specific definition

##### Harmful Algal Blooms HABs
- Algae/ Phytoplankton multiply rapidly resulting in colour change of water, most commonly red or brown
- some produce toxins affecting birds, fishes etc
- Nutrient enrichment, inc in water temp are causes
- similar to [[#^cfb845 | Alagal Blooms]] algal blooms they deplete oxygen 
- Red tide occurs due to pigment in algae it is a misnomer because blooms are not always red, and not associated w/ tides, are not always harmfu

##### Eutrophication : 
-   caused by leaching of **phosphate** and/ or **nitrate** containing fertilisers from agricultural run offs
 - growth of algae called algal bloom - unsustainable and algaes start to die consuming oxygen leaving little for fishes thereby killing them. Algal blooms are of different colour and can be caused due to warm waters ^cfb845
-   Animals start to feed on this dead algae(detritus) and there is an inc in their population. More O2 is consumed than is created leading to the death of animals.
-   Anaerobic conditions also produces various toxins.
-   There are 2 sources of Eutrophication : **Point Sources** → can be pin pointed and **Non Point sources** → different sources difficult to regulate.

They can be mitigated by :
-   **Riparian buffers** : vegetated area to protect streams from impact of adjacent land use.
-   **Minimise non-point pollution**
-   Nitrogen testing and modelling
-   Treatment of run off ex N-Testing
-   Organic farming, integrated farming system
-   Reduction of livestock densities, improve efficiency of fertiliser
-   Reduction in N2 emission from vehicles

The nutrient-enrichment of the lakes promotes the growth of algae, aquatic plants and various fauna. This process is known as **natural eutrophication**.

Similar nutrient enrichment of lakes at an accelerated rate is caused by human activities and the consequent ageing phenomenon is known as '**cultural eutrophication**'.


### Wet Land Ecosystem 
-   Ex : lakes/ponds,estuary, lagoon, creek, backwater, bay, coral reef, tidal flat, salt marsh, etc
-   Are ==areas intermediate in character between **deepwater** and **terrestrial** habitats== and are also transitional.
-   see frequent flooding from deepwater habitats
-   include lake littorals(marginal areas b/w highest and lowest water level of lakes), flood plains, marshy or swampy area where water gets stagnated
-   ==Depth of wet lands do not exceed 6mts at low tide==
-   They have adopted plant life and hydric soils

**Functions of Wetlands** 
-   habitats to flora and fauna
-   Nutrients recycling
-   water purification
-   flood mitigation
-   maintenance of stream flow
-   stabilizes the climate, source of livelihood etc.

**Mitigation of degradation :**
-   Survey and demarcation
-   protection of natural regeneration
-   Artificial regeneration
-   Removing encroachments


Wetlands in India occupy **18.4**% of the country's area of which **70**% is under paddy cultivation.

#### National Wetlands Conservation Programme (NWCP) #scheme :
-   was implemented in the year **1985-86**
-   115 wetlands (Annexure) have been identified
-   Objectives : policy guidelines for conservation, financial assistance, monitor implementation. Central Govt is responsible for overall coordination. State gov resp for management.
 
#### Criteria for identification of national importance is the same as that for Ramsar Convention
-   contains a representative, rare, or unique example of a natural or near-natural wetland type.
-   supports vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered species; or threatened ecological communities
-   supports populations of plant and/or animal species important for maintaining the biological diversity
-   supports plant and/or animal species at a critical stage in their life cycles, or provides refuge during adverse conditions.
-   regularly supports 20,000 or more water birds
-   regularly supports 1% of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of water birds
-   supports a significant proportion of indigenous fish subspecies
-   important source of food for fishes, spawning ground, nursery etc
-   important source of food and water resource, increased possibilities for recreation and eco tourism, improved scenic values, educational opportunities.

#### Montreau Record :
-   **register** of wetland sites on the List of Wetlands of International Importance.
-   highlights those sites where adverse changes in ecological character have occurred or are likely to occur.
-   employed to identify priority sites for positive national and international conservation attention.
-   ==Chilika lake==, Orissa was placed on the Montreux Record in 1993 due to siltation in the mouth of the lake. It was ==removed in 2002==
-   ==Loktak lake, Manipur== was included on the Montreux Record in 1993 due to habitat degradation.
-   ==Keoladeo NP placed in 1990 for over grazing== and water shortage.

The largest floating treatment Wetland in the country is Neknampur lake of Hyderabad.

### Lotic Ecosystem (Rivers)
River ecosystem are flowing waters that drain the landscpae and include biotic and abiotic components.
