-   Large waves, long wavelength and period caused due to undersea disturbance
-   Large, impulsive displacement of sea bed level, landslide triggered tsunamis
-   Risk : occur rarely in IN ocean
-   Distribution Pattern : both East West coastlines are vulnerable, earthquake of 6.5 or greater required
-   Effects depends on seismic event that generated the tsunami, distance from its point of origin, configuration of depth of water in oceans
##   Tsunami warning
-   Predictability through international tsunami warning sys, regional warning sys,
-   INCOIS gives warning in IN 3 stations in Portblair, Minicoy, Shillong 10 minutes in advance
-   ITEWC - IN Tsunami Early Warning Sys by UNESCO it consists of national and international seismic station, sea level gauge station, buoys, 400 seismometers, real time processing of data  4.0 and above

##   NDMA Guidelines
-   Tsunami risk assessment and Vulnerability analysis through dev of models, INHD Naval Hydrographic Department
-   Preparedness - Real time Seismic Monitoring Network RTSMN be estd under IMD, undersea observation platform being worn away, National Data Buoy program by NIOT, Tsunami escape direction sign boards

###     Structural Mitigation Measures 
-   ex cyclone shelters, submerged sand barriers, sand dunes with sea weeds, mangroves and coastal forests
-   Local knowledge centres along coast lines
-   Construction of location specific sea walls and coral reefs
-   Dev of break waters as buffer zones, bio shield - narrow strip of land along coastline
-   ID of vulnerable structures, retrofitting them
-   Strict enforcement of CRZ, adopt techno legal models to ensure compliance
-   Emergency tsunami response - equipping first responders, tsunami safe zoning, planning, design, construction practice etc
-   Ensuring Implementation - aggressive capacity building, use state of the art equipments, conduct regular drills

## Challenges : 
- lack of easily accessible T documentation, 
- lack of high resolution near shore bathymetric topographic data, 
- inadequate awareness, 
- lack of peoples part in strengthening disasters preparedness, mitigation
- emergency in coastal areas, 
- lack of traditional knowledge to tackle
