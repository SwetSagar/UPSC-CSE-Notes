-   Formation - warm airs puch monsoon clouds towards hills
-   Cloudbursts risk mostly in hills, sometimes cause destruction of life and liberty
-   Predictability - no satisfactory technique, precise techniques very expensive

## Cyclone
-   Destruction due to accompanying destructive wind, storm surges, torrential rainfall
-   13 states UT are C prone, AP, Odisha, TN, Guj are highly prone
-   IMD nodal centre for warning, INSAT satellites used

###   Mitigation
-   Efficient forecast, rapid dissemination of warning, cyclone shelters
-   Coastal Belt plantation, Hazard mapping through meteorological records, land use control,
-   engineered structures - construct stilts on earth mound row of planted trees, buildings be water resistant, protect river embankments, strong halls to community shelter
-   Flood management, improve vegetation cover, coastal shelterbelt plantation

####   National Cyclone risk Mitigation Project NCRMP in vulnerable states
-   4 components are A - last mile connectivity
-   B - Structural Non Structural measures
-   C - Technical assistance for risk mitigation
-   D - Project Mgt and implementation support

###   Challenges  
lack of adequate response, planning, coordination, communication infra lack, end facilities
