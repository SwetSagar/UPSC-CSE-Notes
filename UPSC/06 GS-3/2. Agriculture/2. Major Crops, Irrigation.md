-   Irrigation is artificial application of water, assist growth
-   Well and Tube Well I -
    -   In UP, Bihar, TN ex shallow wells, deep wells, tube wells, artesian
    -   Advantages - cheap, easy to use, independent source, add fertility to soil
    -   Demerits - limited areas can be irrigated, depletes ground water, not enough capacity
-   Canal Irrigation
    -   In areas of low level relief, deep fertile soils, perennial, extensive command areas in UP, PUN, HAR
    -   Inundation C - water mainly in rainy season vs Perennial
    -   Merits : perennial, saves crops from droughts
    -   Demerits : overflow during rainy, suitable for plains only
-   Tank - Ktaka, MP, Maha, Odisha, Kerala
    -   Merits : natural, not costly, longer life span, fishing etc also carried
    -   Demerits : drying up, lifting water and carrying to field requires cost
-   Drip : use drippers, low level, most efficient, practiced on large crops
    -   M : Fertilizer, Nutrient loss is min, field levelling not necessary, reduced leaching, recycled non potable water can be used, water application efficiency increases, soil erosion, weed growth negligible
    -   D : initial cost can be more, clogging, time, harvest, loss if not installed properly
-   Sprinkler : sprayed in air, suitable for uneven land, shallow soils
    -   M : suitable for all types of soil, water saving, inc yield, saves land
    -   D : Higher initial cost, efficiency dec in high wind high temp
-   Furrow - trenches are dug, difficulty is ensuring uniform dispersion, water loss
-   Surge Irrigation type of furrow, Ditch Irrigation
-   Sub Irrigation - water delivered from below soil, absorbed upwards
    -   M : water and nutrient conservation, labour saving
    -   D : outfitting cost is relatively high, inc presence of disease in recycle water

 
# Static : Transport and Marketing of Agri produce and issues and related constraints
2020-10-22 07:57:58

---

-   Transport - delivering product from farmers to final consumers, includes pre post harvesting, assembling, grading, storage, transportation and distribution
-   Role - transmit macroeconomic signals, balance demand/ supply, providing incentives to producers to inc production and output, promote efficient use
-   Regulatory measures

#### APMC Act
-   Mandates sale/purchase in specified markets
-   Prices determined by open auction, conducted in transparent manner
-   Market charges can be made from sale proceeds
-   Farmers - APMC Mandis - Auctioning of produce to establish price - produce sold - commission agent charge
-   Adv - removes malpractices, transparent, ensures fair deal
-   D : encourage private trade, prevents private investment, act has reduced competition

##### Model APMC Act 2003
-   Private and cooperatives can set up licensed markets
-   Provides for contract farming, provides for contract farming, direct marketing by private players

Problems facing agri marketing sys -
-   Too many intermediaries, inadequate infra, private sector unwilling to invest, non-transparent price setting mechanism, ill equipped untrained staff, market info not easily accessible
-   ECA
-   Agri produce Grading Marketing Act
    -   Defines standards of quality, prescribes grade specification for no of products
    -   Authorises agri marketing advisor in each state
-   Private and Coop sector in Marketing agri produce
    -   Removal of licensing requirements on buying, stocking, transporting in Agri products, Milk and Milk product order
    -   Safal - fruits, vegetables auction market, eliminates middle men
    -   Mother Dairy food procuring, ITC E-choupal
-   Initiatives to promote link b/w producers and consumers - Shetkari bazaars, Apni Mandis, Rythu Bazaars, Krushak Bazaars, Uzhavar Sandhais
-   Farmer Producer Orgs - informal farmer groups, marketing coops, producer coys
-   Organised Retail Outlets

-   ICT divided into 3 categories - those which aim at empowerment, enablement and Market expansion
-   Helps farmers have better access to information, in soil management, water, seed, Fertiliser, Pest, Harvest, Post-Harvest
-   Uses Remote sensing, computer simulation, assessment of speed and direction, soil quality assays, Crop yield predictions, Marketing
-   Recent initiatives
    -   e-NAM to integrate agri market online, view all info, commodity arrivals and prices
    -   IFFO iMandi - social commerce app, for large communities
    -   Export Inspection Council EIC promote ease of agri exports
    -   Meghdoot app, Kisan Suvidha, Pusa Krishi app
-   Importance - remedies water crisis, desertification, crop pests; develops efficient methods of advancement; make better informed decisions
-   Challenges - lack of infra, right input and advisory, poor reach, Illiteracy, adoption issues/affordability,
-   Need - outreach, monitoring, behavioural reforms, digital literacy
-   Precision agri - use of satellite farming mgt concept, use ICT to manage crop health
-   AI - simulates human intelligence, Learning, Reasoning, Self-correction
-   Block Chain
-   Food Systems are activities that involve producing, processing, transporting and consuming foods ^cb312c
