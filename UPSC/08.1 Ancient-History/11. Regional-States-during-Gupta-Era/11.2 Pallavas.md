#MainsPYQ 

> **KAN Sastri** :  From the middle of 6th century AD history of South India is story of mutual conflict among three powers
-   Tungabhadra natural boundary fertile rice growing region, high land revenue, prestige, political supremacy -> this is the reason *Why?* hostility started b/w Pallavas and Chalukyas.
- Hostility started during Mahendravarmans reign.
-   Pulakesin II's Aihole inscription - he defeated Mahendravarman, P ceded northern areas to him
-   Narsimhavarman I

-   *Paramesvara Varman I won against Chalukyas* - Udayendram Plates
- *Chalukya king Vikramaditya II in 733 AD is said to have run over Kanchi for over 3 times*. Pallavas were completely routed and were no longer a threat. A century later they were wiped out by the Cholas.
