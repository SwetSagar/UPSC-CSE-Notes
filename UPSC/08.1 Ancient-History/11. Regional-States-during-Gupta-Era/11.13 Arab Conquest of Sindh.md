The advent of Arabs in India had a significant historical impact on various aspects of Indian society, culture, religion and politics. Here are some of the effects of Arab conquest:

The advent of Arabs introduced Islam to India, which became one of the major religions in India over time. The Arabs also spread their language, script, literature, art and architecture to India.
The advent of Arabs also established trade and cultural contacts between India and West Asia, which enriched both regions with knowledge, ideas and goods. The Arabs learned from India about administration, astronomy, music, painting, medicine and numerals and transmitted them to Europe. India also benefited from Arab learning in fields such as mathematics, medicine, geography and philosophy.

The advent of Arabs also influenced the political scenario of India, as they challenged the existing rulers of Sind and other regions. They also paved the way for subsequent invasions by Turks and other Muslim dynasties who established their empires in India[^1 ] 3 4 . The Arab conquest also led to some changes in the administrative and legal systems of India, such as the introduction of Jaziya (a tax on non-Muslims) and Sharia (Islamic law).
