## Kalhan's Rajtarangini (River of Kings):
-   Composed in 12th century has 8 books called ==Tarangas==, modern sense of historiography reflected in it was caused by
    -   distinct geography of Kashmir 
    -   rise of feudalism -> strong regional attachment
    -   Proximity to Central Asia, China; 
    -   Dev of Buddhism influenced Kashmir through its hagiographical writing
    -   Turbulent period
-   Analysed royal charters, edicts, records of land grants, documents, coins, inscriptions etc

### Political
-   History since first Hindu King ==Gonanda to last Jayasimha==
-   contains genealogies and chronology, achievements in details

#### Book I - III
-   52 kings said to have ruled, mentions only 17 kings,

-   Rich drank wines, ate meat, poor ate vegetables
-   ==Harsha introduced long coat in Kashmir==
-   Agriculture and water works dams to prevent landslide made by **Avantivarman** -> econ prosperity

### Critical Analysis
-   Earlier history based on myths, legends
-   concept of time/age is used as in Itihasa Purana
-   Assessment of ==literature, Kingship, reign dynasty have high standard of accuracy== showing eminent features of a historian
-   Impartiality, honest account, ==does not hide errors==, praises enemies for courage
-   Uses rhetorical elements like similes, puns, poetic skills
-   Establishes chronology of events, directly influenced by Buddhist and Brahmanical literary sense
