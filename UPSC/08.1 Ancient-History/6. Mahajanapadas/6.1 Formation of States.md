- The emergence of Janapadas signified the birth of geography in Indian history. In vedic society people were not attached to one area.
- Villages. towns and clties were the units where the people lived.
- this was the time when kings and monarchs emerged. This was also the age of intense philosophical speculation. Buddhism, Jainism and many other heterodox sects emerged

## Sources

- The Brahmanas and the Upanishads were composed from 800 BC they mention many janapadas and Mahajanapadas.
- Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka tells about the social life of people.
- Jatakas dealing with the stories of the previous births of the Buddha are part of the Sutta Pitaka.
- Various archaeological evidences from Ahichchhatra, Ujjain, Hastinapur, Atraji Khera, Sravasti, Vaishal etc. They have given a distinctive pottery called NBPW.
- During the later vedic phase people took up agriculture and began to settle down, these places were known as Janapadas.
- The texts that mention about the Mahajanapadas are :
	- **Anguttara Nikaya**
	- Mahavastu
	- Bhagavati Sutra → not reliable

## Emergence of New Categories of people/ Society

### Gahapati

- master of an individual household which owned land, which became an imp form of wealth.
- Bigger one cultivated their lands with the help of slaves or hired labourers called the karmakara and Shudras

### Merchants

- **Setthi**, meaning 'a person having the best' is referred to in Buddhist texts.
- By the 6th century BC trade and merchandise became an independent source of economic activity led to the emergence of free peasants and merchants. Free from clan obligations of sharing surplus food or wealth.
- Concept of Private property had emerged.

### Ruler and the Ruled

- The rulers of this period ruled over their lineage and the notion of ruling over a territory had not emerged.
- taxes collected from the kinsmen were largely voluntary tributes
- There are references to Krsaka i.e. peasants who paid taxes to the king
- The Praja included people from the non-lineage groups also they were not related with kinship ties to the Ruler.
- Raids now changed into organised campaigns in which territory annexed and agriculturists and traders were forced to pay taxes.
- Bhagadugha collected bhaga i.e. a share of the agricultural produce. Survey of the agricultural land was done by an official called Rajjugahaka

### Social Life (Extra)

- **Jivaka** was the court physician of Bimbisara who also looked after Buddha.
- Villages - Gama/Grama was the equivalent to a unit of settlement in a Mahajanpada. In villages people generally pursued agricultural activities.
- Dasas, karmakaras and porisas were labourers. Villages inhabited by non-kinship groups also came into existence.
- **Kassaka** and **ksetrika** denoted the common peasants who were generally of the Sudra jati.
- The leaders of the villages were called Gamini
- Towns and cities dominated by Kings and merchants are variously referred to as Pura, Nigma and Nigama
- cities had emerged as the focus of power and control over the Mahajanapada
