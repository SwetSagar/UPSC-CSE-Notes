![[1.2 Literary Sources#Sangam Literature :]]

- Sangam Age lasted from 3rd century BCE to 3rd cent. AD.

The Sangam culture refers to the Iron Age culture of Southern India, particularly in the southernmost parts of the Indian subcontinent, including present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The period is known to scholars as the Sangam Era of Tamil literature, which is generally dated to the late centuries BCE to early centuries CE. Archaeologically, this period corresponds to the Chalcolithic and early Iron Age periods of South India.

This Iron Age culture is postulated to have been the source of the development of Dravidian culture in general, and the Tamil language in particular. The most comprehensive source of information about the Sangam period is the corpus of Sangam literature comprised of 2,381 poems in Tamil composed by 473 poets, some with their patron kings named. These poems are classified under seven known anthologies and are generally divided into the Eighteen Greater Texts and the Ten Idylls or Lesser Texts.

Other sources of information about this era include archaeological data such as excavations around the modern cities of Chennai and Kaveri River valley. Graeco-Roman sources such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and Strabo’s Geography, as well as the writings of various Roman historians, including Pliny, Plutarch, Dionysius and Tacitus, are also important sources of information about the Sangam period. This period was also when the Indian Bhagavata, Jaina, and Pancharatra religious philosophies were gaining prominence in the southern part of India, which may have been further influenced by early Buddhist ideas coming from what is now Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand.

The art, architecture, and coins of this period also provide important clues about the nature of the Sangam culture. Coins of this period often bear symbols, such as the bull, fish, and thunderbolt, that are still used as symbols of Dravidian culture today. In addition, cave paintings from the Vijayanagara period (13th to 17th centuries) depict figures that reflect the style of the early Sangam period.

The archaeological data from the Sangam age have also revealed several artifacts, including tools and pottery from residential sites, graves, and storage pits, as well as seals and figurines of horses and warriors, which provide valuable insights into the social, religious, and cultural life of this period.

Ancient Tamil literature contains a wealth of information about the social conditions of Tamil country, providing an accurate picture of the diverse classes of society in the ancient world. Not only do these texts discuss the major ruling elites, but they also provide insight into the lives of common people, peasants, laborers and traders.

One of the earliest texts, the classical Sangam literature, gives us a glimpse into the lives of the three major classes of ancient Tamil society – the rulers, the agriculturists and the pastoral nomads. The literature discusses the social stratification, everyday life of various communities, the trading and agricultural work and the various laws governing Tamil society. It also sheds light on the hierarchical caste system which was prominent in those days, along with the prevailing practices of dowry and arranged marriages.

Another example of ancient Tamil literature which provides information on social conditions is Jain literature, which was written primarily between the 4th and 10th centuries AD. This literature gives insights into the economy and trading practices, along with details of how the various classes interacted, both intimately and in public. It also describes the various restrictions, privileges and duties that each class had to adhere to in order to maintain the status quo.

The early Sangam literature is a rich source of information about the complex socio-cultural milieu of Peninsular India. It consists of eight anthologies of poems (Ettuttokai), ten long poems (Pattupattu), and a grammar and rhetoric treatise (Tolkappiyam). The poems are divided into two main categories: akam (love) and puram (heroism, war, politics, etc.). The Sangam literature reflects the following salient features of the cultural traditions of South India:

- The Sangam literature depicts a vivid picture of the geography, flora, fauna, climate, seasons, and natural phenomena of the region. It also mentions the names of various kingdoms, cities, rivers, mountains, and forests. The poems are classified into five landscapes (tinai) based on the nature and mood of the poems: kurinji (hilly region), mullai (pastoral land), marutam (agricultural land), neital (coastal land), and palai (desert land)²⁹.
- The Sangam literature reveals the social structure, occupations, customs, beliefs, and values of the people. The society was divided into four castes: arasar (kings and nobles), antanar (Brahmins and priests), vanigar (merchants and traders), and vellalar (farmers and landowners). There were also other groups such as hunters, fishermen, artisans, and warriors. The poems mention various occupations such as farming, herding, hunting, fishing, weaving, blacksmithing, carpentry, shipping, and trading[^10^] ⁹.
- The Sangam literature portrays the status and role of women in the society. Women were respected and educated. They participated in various fields such as literature, arts, religion, politics, and warfare. Some women poets such as Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipatiniyar contributed to the Sangam literature. Some women warriors such as Alli, Velu Nachiyar, and Velir Kilar fought bravely in battles. Some women rulers such as Sivagami, Nayanar, and Mangaiyarkkarasi governed their kingdoms wisely⁹ [^10^].
- The Sangam literature reflects the religious and philosophical thoughts of the people. The people worshipped various gods and goddesses, such as Murugan, Siva, Vishnu, Indra, Varuna, and Korravai. They also revered the ancestors, spirits, and natural forces. They believed in karma, rebirth, and liberation. They followed various ethical codes and moral values, such as aram (virtue), porul (wealth), inbam (pleasure), and veezham (fate). They also practiced various rituals, sacrifices, festivals, and pilgrimages²⁹.
- The Sangam literature exhibits the artistic and literary excellence of the people. The poems are composed in various meters, rhyme schemes, and styles. They use various figures of speech, such as similes, metaphors, alliterations, and personifications. They also employ various symbols, imagery, and allegories. The poems are rich in emotions, expressions, and imagination. They convey various themes, such as love, war, heroism, patriotism, loyalty, friendship, and wisdom²⁹.

Thus, the early Sangam literature presents an accurate picture of the complex socio-cultural milieu of Peninsular India. It is a valuable treasure of the ancient Tamil culture and civilization²⁹.
