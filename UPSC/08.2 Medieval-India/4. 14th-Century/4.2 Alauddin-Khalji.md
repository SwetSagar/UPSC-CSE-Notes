AK as a despotic Ruler
-   Barani criticises for his policy of excessive bloodshed, harsh and tyrannical behaviour, puts hardships on others to obey his orders

```ad-Views
**Dr. Ishwari Prasad** : “The reign of Ala-ud-Din represents the high watermark of despotism.” 

**Lane-poole** calls Ala-ud-Din “a bloody and unscrupulous tyrant. He has summed up the personality and rule : “Though he might be wrong-headed and disdainful of the low, he was a man of determination, who knew his own mind, saw the necessity of the situation, met it by his own methods, and carried out those methods, with persistence.”

“In the words of **Dr. V.A. Smith**, “He was particularly a savage tyrant— exceedingly disgraceful in many respects.”

## Alauddin Khalji's Agrarian reforms 

### Source
-   Barani is source
    -   3 groups of rural aristocracy **khut (replaced ranas/rais at district/pargana level)** , **muqaddam**, and **chaudhuri** who collected land revenue called Kharaj
    -   were given perquisites (haqq-i khoti) remuneration by state also took some share from peasants (qismat-i-khoti) 
    -   Every cultivator pay house tax called Ghari, grazing tax - charai
 
 
###  Alaudding introduced stern measures against collectors of revenue because of 
-   Did not pay revenue on their land, *shifted burden to peasants*
-   Not pay grazing tax
-   Excess wealth made them arrogant, flouted orders

### To strike fear took the measures 
-   State demand half/50% of produce of land, Land measured (masahat) and revenue fixed on yield (wafa-i-biswa) per unit of are
-   Intermediaries, peasants to pay same standard of demand (50%)

### Ghiyasuddin introduced 2 changes to it 
-   intermediaries got back their haqq-i khoti (but not qismat-i khoti), also exempted from the house and cattle tax.
-   procedure of measurement (masahat) was to continue along with observation or "actual yield"
 
###  It did not survive beyond Khalji because/ Impact of AK's market reforms :
-   Lack of sufficiently competent administration.
-   more spent on controlling the prices around Delhi instead of dispersing it widely - lower revenues
-   K/M etc were too powerful, Mubarak Shah restored them their rights, released prisoners, took back laws
-   Tried to control prices of all goods - often violated invited punishment - resentment
