### Problems Faced by Balban during His Rule

- <https://www.historyforexam.com/2018/12/problems-faced-by-balban.html>
- Internal dissensions from Nobles -> more serious threat, attempt by Rajputs, Rajas, Big Zamindars to expel them ex from Gwalior, Ranthambore
- Lakhnauti rulers tried to assert their independence ex Yuzbek, Thughril were appt by Balban.
- Mongol Threat -> Rulers of Ghuz, Ghazni ousted by M captured cis Indus region.

### Assessment of Balban

- Stern enforcement of law -> basis for growth, future expansion of Sultanat
- Revenues previously appropriated by Chihalgani now went to Gov
- No large scale building activity, emphasis more on army
- Kept Mongols at bay, but not able to push them beyond Lahore
- ! Failed to control Tughril's rebellion
- ! Resorted to policy of poison, secret assassination of nobles to break Chihalghani's power; Exaggeration of family, ancestry. Both proved counter productive
- Built a polity not capable of sustaining itself, but had capacity of expansion.
