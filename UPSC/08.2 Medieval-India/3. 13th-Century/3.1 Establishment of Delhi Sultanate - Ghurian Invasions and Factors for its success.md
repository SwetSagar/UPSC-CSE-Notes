-   Invasions of Mahmud of Ghazni were actual precurosrs of the beginning  from 1000 AD - 1030 AD, brokedown IN resistance


### Ghurid Invasions 
-   objective to gain control over Punjab and Sindh, through Gomal pass, conquering Peshawar, Ucch and Multan by 1179
-   attacked Bhatinda in 1191 but defeated returned to defeat the Chauhan Rajputs at Tarain 1192
- !  1st Battle of Tarain : Ghori aka Muizzuddin Muhammad bin Sam captured Tabarhinda fort, P defeated G,
- ! 2nd Battle : 1192
    - $  Minhaz Siraj, Ferishta's, Hasan Nizami accounts are sources
    - $  Ferishta - all leading rais were under Prithviraj

-   Jayachandra Ghadavala dyn defeated and Banaras, Asni captured
-   By end of 12 C most doab, Bundelkhand captured
-   Under Bakhtiar Khalji Magadha and Bengal were subdued


### Reasons for Turkic success 
-   **Lack of centralized power** : After fall of GP empire, no single state took its place.
-   **Small states** :  Gahadavalas in Kannauj, Parmaras in Malwa, Chalukyas in Gujarat, Chauhans in Ajmer, Tomars in Delhi, Chandellas in Bundelkhand rose but they quarreled among themselves
-   peculiar social hierarchy
    - $  **Fakhr Mudabbir** in his Adab-ul Harb wa'al Shuja excluded majority of pop from mil training, concept of untouchability led soldiers who were high caste do all of the menial works themselves
-   Use iron stirrup and horse shoes increased striking power,mobility and stamina of cavalry
-   Area around Ghur was rich in iron, tradition of weapons production
-   constant feud b/w states of central Asia - to their militarisation,
-   horses well bred, cavalry skilled, fast moving, Elephants slow moving
-   **Ghazi spirit** -> defending and spreading Islam
-   **Iqta system** -> to collect land revenue, taxes only, was to furnish troops to the sultan
-   Subuktigin defeated the Hindu Shahi ruler Jayapal annexed Kabul and Jalalabad paved way for early inroad.
-   Ghazni gave patronage to Firdausi.
-   Invasions period was of great flux and confusion

### Consolidation 
####    Aibak (1206-1210)
- !  Moved capital to Lahore to counter **Yalduz** also defend against Khwarizm shah
-   Expansion -> Foundation of Turkish Rule in Upper Ganga
-   Aibak governor of Hissar Sirsa, captured Delhi in 1192 on the pretext of rebellion from Tomars similarly Ajmer annexed
-   Jaichand of Ghadavals rejoiced P's defeat did not help the Dor Rajputs - Defeated in 1194 Asni/Fatehpur and Varanasi plundered
-   From 1194-1198 Bayana, Gwalior, Kalinjar, Mahoba, Khajuraho captured
-   Kannauj captured in 1198
-   Turkish power was still limited were not able to hold positions

#### Ghazni compared to Ghori
-   Ghazni a better General never lost a battle.
- Ghori had political realism, sense of purpose, not afraid to change plans.
-   Both used religion, gathered wealth to fund Central Asia campaign, enriched their Buildings.

#### Problems faced during Consolidation
-   Rebellion of ousted rules esp Rajputs
-   Factionalism in Turkish nobility - political instability ex in Multan, Sindh, Lakhnauti
-   Central Asian crisis after death of Ghuri
-   Rise of Mongols + deprivation of support from Ghur prevented further expansion

# The Mongol Problem 
>  KA Nizami Indian response in 3 distinct phases : **aloofeness**, **appeasement** and **resistance**

1.   **Aloofness** : by Iltutmish, alliance of Mangbarni and Khokhars of Punjab was dangerous for Iltutmish he was also aware of the weakness of his new formed state
		- $ avoided political alliance with Khwarizm prince even leading an expedition against him as per Minhaz Siraj
1.   **Appeasement** from Razia's reign 1236 continued till 1260* inspite of the invasion threat from the Khan of Transoxiana
2.   **Resitance** from Balbans reign used both force and diplomacy
	    -   reinforced forts at Bhatinda, Sunam and Samana and captured Multan, Uchh
- @  Mongols under Qutlugh Khwaja ravaged Del during *Khalji's reign 1303
- AK recruited huge standing army, repulsed them 1306, 1308
- successful defence of IN and Mongol destruction of Central Asia saw migration of scholars, mystics, artisans
