-   Some say they were a means of social and cultural revolution. This was not so since a structural change in society was beyond the capacity of the Sufis. 


### Role of Sufi saints/movement in the dev of Vernacular language, on thought of people
- [x]   #todo 
- Chistis believed in the use of simple language.
- Challenged Arabo-Persian liguistic hegemony through the use of vernacular dilect to propagate the message of sufism.
- ! Contributed to the dev of literary genres ex Prem kahani. 
- The sufi saints carried the idea of Islam with them which was adapted esp by the lower sections of the populace.
- The cultural assimilation of Ajlaf/ lower class muslims was faster. They readily adopted vernacular language in their day to day life. In this the sufi's were prime agents for this.
- Khanqah provided for a place of discourse among various sections of people -> acted as place of cultural dissipation such as language.
- Bengali language is an example of this.
- ~ Makhdum Nuh a sufi saint in 16th century translated Quran in Persian language. 
- Other  saints during the 18th 19th century tranlated the Quran into Urdu and Purabi Hindi dialect. 
- Produced poetry in Rajasthani, Punjabi, Sindhi, Marathi, Bengali, Bihari, Dakkhani, Tamil etc.
- Muinuddin Chisti of Ajmer had learnt Hindustani language. Hamid aldin Siwali of Nagaur used the Hindavi langugae. Baba farid used local language.
- Sufis used feminine voice in Punjabi, Sindhi, Urdu lang.
- Also led to the dev of new scripts of languages such as Sindhi.

### Failure of Sufi and Bhakti Movement :
- [x]   #todo 
- Preaching in local language made the nobles aloof from their influence and prevented their patronage.
- Nomadic nature of them made it difficult to record many of their poetic verses.
- No institutional structure prevented a long term change since lineage of saints could not continue.
- Failed to offer a proper alternative to prevailing social/religious customs that they often attacked.
- It was difficult for these saints who often came from lower sections to break their religious and social customs to form a new cult.
- Limited geographical reach within the subcontinent.
- Factionism among the various sufi orders/ silsilas and Bhakti saints,
- Exaggerated reverence of saints brought them to brink of image worship esp at therr tombs.
- Sometimes created an atmosphere of sycophancy.
- Rationalism was denounced by the Sufis which led to inc in miracle mongering and suspicion about science and scientists. Which restricted growth of science.
