# CA Supreme Court Collegium

2019-05-12 14:50:38


---

## Collegium System:

- Headed by CJI + 4 SC Judges
- recommendations binding to gov if the Collegium sends the names of the judges/lawyers to the government for 2nd time
- No time limit to reply -> Hence appointment takes long time
- central gov does fact checking
- no mention in constitution
- Consesus required for appointment

![[Supreme-Court-Collegium-image1-23205818.jpg]]

**Gender disparity in Collegium/ Judiciary**

- SC has had only 8 female judges / 239
- low f judges in subordinate judiciary
- only 1 women collegium member so far no female CJI.

### Too Few SC Judges Issues

- Supreme Court Judge strength inc from 31 to 34, to deal with paucity of judges
- increase in the SCs strength may not be enough.
- Require :
    - restraint the duration of oral arguments.
    - adherence to schedule of hearings.
    - preserve the apex court's primary role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional questions and statutory interpretation [Article 145(3)](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/244297/).
- **229th Law Commission Reoport** : one Constitution Bench in Delhi, and four '*Cassation Benches* these will be final appellate courts for routine litigation.

- FTCs now to clear the cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act :
- 581 FTCs operational 5.9 lakh pending cases.
- districts with more than 100 cases pending need to make FTCs.
- Issues :
	- decline of FTCs variation in kinds of cases handled,
	- lacked technological resources
	- Inadequate staff
	- Delay in getting reports, adjournments
	- over-listing of cases
- Needs :
	- Identifying systemic issues and addressing the concerns,
	- Equal attention must be paid to metropolitan and far-flung non-metropolitan areas.
	- States will need to take stock of the issues at the ground level

### Judges Cases

The primary question was the meaning of term 'in consultation' mentioned in Art 124 and 222.

- **1st Judges case 1981**: 7 judge bench *reaffirmed that consultation does not mean concurrence* that was laid down before in Sankalchand Case. And transfers must be in national interest after consulting CJI.
	- During this time Transfers were made by the President acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
	- The case thus gave Executive's decision primacy of CJI's.
- Supreme Court Advocates on record case aka **2nd Judges case** 1993
	- '*Consultation Really meant concurrence*' this consultary opinion of CJI was to be formed along w/ 2 senior most Judges of SC.
	- Thus ==introduced Collegium system==.
	- Said CJI has not only primacy but is determinative.
	- Views of Transfered judge should be given in writing.
- **3rd Judges case 1998**
	- expanded collegium to 5 mem body.
	- CJI was to consult CJ of HC and HC where judge was to be transferred whose views were to be given in writing.
	- Judge to be transferred could put his views in front of CJI.
- **4th Judges case**
	- NJAC(99th Amendment) quashed in 2015.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|     Critically examine   the Supreme Court’s judgement on ‘National Judicial Appointments Commission   Act, 2014’ with reference to appointment of judges of higher judiciary in   India.                                                                                                                                                                                           |     2017    |
|     What was held in   the Coelho case? In this context, can you say that judicial review is of key   importance amongst the basic features of the Constitution?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     2016    |
|     Resorting to   ordinances has always raised concern on violation of the spirit of separation   of powers doctrine. While noting the rationales justifying the power to   promulgate ordinances, analyze whether the decisions of the Supreme Court on   the issue have further facilitated resorting to this power. Should the power   to promulgate ordinances be repealed?    |     2015    |
|     Starting from   inventing the ‘basic structure’ doctrine, the judiciary has played a highly   proactive role in ensuring that India develops into a thriving democracy. In   light of the statement, evaluate the role played by judicial activism in   achieving the ideals of democracy.                                                                                      |     2014    |
|     The Supreme Court   of India keeps a check on arbitrary power of the Parliament in amending the   Constitution. Discuss critically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     2013    |
