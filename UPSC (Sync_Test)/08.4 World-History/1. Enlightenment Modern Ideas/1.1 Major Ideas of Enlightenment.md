The Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, was a cultural and intellectual movement in the 18th century that emphasized the use of reason and individualism over traditional authority and dogma. It represented a shift in thinking away from traditional religious and feudal systems towards a more secular and rational worldview.

One of the key ideas of the Enlightenment was the belief in the power of human reason to understand and improve the world. Philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Voltaire believed that reason and science could be used to understand the natural world and to improve society. They championed the idea of progress and the potential for human beings to improve their lives through the use of reason and science.

Another important aspect of the Enlightenment was the idea of individualism. Philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that individuals had natural rights and that government should exist to protect those rights. This idea laid the foundation for modern liberal democracy and the concept of individual freedom and autonomy.

The Enlightenment also represented a shift in attitudes towards religion and tradition. Many Enlightenment thinkers rejected traditional religious authority and instead embraced a more secular worldview. They believed that religion should be based on reason and evidence rather than faith and dogma. This led to a decline in the power of the Church and the rise of secularism.

In addition to these ideas, the Enlightenment also brought about new ways of thinking about art, literature, and culture. The emphasis on reason and individualism led to a new style of literature and art that celebrated the individual and rejected traditional forms. This new approach to art and literature was known as Romanticism.

However, it is important to note that the Enlightenment was not a monolithic movement and there were different schools of thought within it. For example, some Enlightenment thinkers such as Montesquieu and Adam Smith advocated for a more limited government, while others such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed in a stronger central government.

Additionally, it is also important to note that the Enlightenment was not a movement that was inclusive of all people. The enlightenment principles were mostly applied to white, wealthy, educated men. Women and people of color were largely excluded from these ideas and movements.

1.  Reason over tradition: The Enlightenment emphasized the use of reason and science as a way to understand the world and improve society, rather than relying on tradition and authority. This represented a shift away from traditional religious and feudal systems towards a more secular and rational worldview.
    
2.  Individualism: The Enlightenment championed the idea of individual rights and autonomy, and the belief that government should exist to protect those rights. This laid the foundation for modern liberal democracy and the concept of individual freedom.
    
3.  Progress: Enlightenment thinkers believed in the potential for human beings to improve their lives through the use of reason and science, and championed the idea of progress.
    
4.  Secularism: Enlightenment thinkers rejected traditional religious authority and instead embraced a more secular worldview, leading to a decline in the power of the Church and the rise of secularism.
    
5.  Human Rights: Philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that individuals had natural rights and that government should exist to protect those rights. This laid the foundation for the concept of human rights.
    
6.  Scientific inquiry: The Enlightenment saw a rise in scientific inquiry and experimentation, with scientists such as Isaac Newton and Galileo making important discoveries in fields such as physics and astronomy.
    
7.  Empiricism: The Enlightenment saw the rise of empiricism, the idea that knowledge comes from observation and experience, as opposed to intuition or authority.
    
8.  Tolerance: Many Enlightenment thinkers emphasized the idea of tolerance for different opinions and beliefs, and rejected the use of force to impose one's beliefs on others.
    
9.  Criticism: The Enlightenment saw a rise in critical thinking and skepticism, with philosophers such as Voltaire and David Hume questioning traditional beliefs and institutions.
    
10.  Romanticism: The emphasis on reason and individualism led to a new style of literature and art that celebrated the individual and rejected traditional forms. This new approach to art and literature was known as Romanticism.
    
These alternative approaches to modernity were modern in the sense that they represented a break from traditional ways of thinking and a shift towards a more secular, rational, and individualistic worldview. They also marked a departure from previous approaches, which emphasized tradition, authority, and religious dogma. For example, the emphasis on reason and science during the Enlightenment represented a break from the previously dominant Aristotelian worldview, which relied on intuition and authority. Similarly, the idea of individual rights and autonomy championed by Enlightenment thinkers represented a break from the traditional feudal systems of the past.

Rousseau

1. "Rousseau's political philosophy contains the seeds of Socialism, Absolutism and Democracy." Comment. [2004, 20 Marks]
- [Social Contract - 'Man is born free but everywhere](onenote:[[Rousseau]]&section-id={F821C244-4A9F-4D85-ACDA-1EC6F1092EE3}&page-id={DDB7A541-9A4A-4DE6-BCBD-3E35B5179534}&object-id={339FC84F-F4D2-48FC-B412-2CE4FBAF6BC8}&20&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/bbc8be5bd337910c/Documents/History%20Optional/World%20History/Part%20I/Enlightenment%5eJ%20Modern%20Ideas.one)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political philosophy is complex and multifaceted, and it contains elements of socialism, absolutism, and democracy.

Rousseau's idea of the "general will" in his work "The Social Contract" is an early form of socialism. The general will is the idea that the collective will of the people should be the guiding principle in government, and that the state should exist to serve the needs of the people. This idea is similar to the principles of socialism, which advocate for the collective ownership and control of resources and the fair distribution of wealth.

On the other hand, Rousseau's idea of the "sovereign" in the same work represents an early form of absolutism. The sovereign is a unified and absolute authority that represents the general will of the people and has the power to make laws and enforce them. This idea of an all-powerful sovereign is similar to the principles of absolutism, which advocate for a strong central government with unlimited power.

However, Rousseau's idea of the social contract, where the people agree to give up some of their individual freedom in exchange for protection and security by the government, also has elements of democracy. The social contract is a way for the people to collectively govern themselves, and it is a fundamental principle of democracy.

1.  In "The Social Contract," Rousseau writes, "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole." This passage shows his idea of the "general will," which is an early form of socialism where the collective will of the people should be the guiding principle in government and the state should exist to serve the needs of the people.
    
2.  In "The Social Contract," Rousseau also writes, "The whole people, united by a single act of association, will then form a moral person, possessing an independent life and will, and able to act as such in all that concerns its preservation and well-being." This passage shows his idea of the sovereign, a unified and absolute authority that represents the general will of the people and has the power to make laws and enforce them, which is similar to the principles of absolutism.
    
3.  In "The Social Contract," Rousseau also writes, "The social pact, far from destroying natural equality, substitutes, on the contrary, a moral and lawful equality for whatever physical inequality that nature may have imposed on mankind; so that however unequal in strength and intelligence, men become equal by covenant and by right." This passage shows his idea of social contract, where the people agree to give up some of their individual freedom in exchange for protection and security by the government.
    
4.  In "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men," Rousseau writes, "The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said 'This is mine,' and found people naive enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society." This passage shows his critique of private property, a principle that is often associated with socialism.
    
5.  In "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men," Rousseau also writes, "In this state man is at his most independent: he owes nothing to anyone, he expects nothing from anyone; he is self-sufficient." This passage shows his emphasis on individualism, a principle that is often associated with democracy.
    
7.  In "Emile, or On Education," Rousseau also writes, "The essential condition for the preservation of freedom is the general obedience to laws to which every citizen has consented." This passage shows his emphasis on the importance of laws and the rule of law, a principle that is often associated with democracy.
    
8.  In "Confessions," Rousseau writes, "I love life in a state of nature, the life of savages, which seems to me the only one that is natural to man." This passage shows his admiration of the natural state of mankind, a principle that is often associated with socialism.
    
9.  In "Confessions," Rousseau also writes, "I love freedom, I hate constraint, and I cannot bear to be dependent." This passage shows his emphasis on individual freedom, a principle that is often associated with democracy.
    
10.  In "Letter to M. D'Alembert on the Theater," Rousseau writes, "The theater is the mirror of the society in which it exists; and it is in this sense that it can be said that it is a powerful means of educating the people and shaping public opinion. This passage shows his belief in the power of the arts to shape society and influence the people, which is often associated with democracy.

11.  In "Letter to M. D'Alembert on the Theater," Rousseau also writes, "The theater is a powerful means of educating the people and shaping public opinion." This passage shows his belief in the power of the arts to shape society and influence the people, which is often associated with democracy.
    
12.  In "Considerations on the Government of Poland," Rousseau writes, "The general will is always in the right and always tends towards the public good." This passage shows his idea of the general will, which is an early form of socialism where the collective will of the people should be the guiding principle in government and the state should exist to serve the needs of the people.
    
13.  In "Considerations on the Government of Poland," Rousseau also writes, "The sovereign, being formed wholly of the individuals who compose it, neither has nor can have any interest contrary to theirs." This passage shows his idea of the sovereign, a unified and absolute authority that represents the general will of the people and has the power to make laws and enforce them, which is similar to the principles of absolutism.
    
14.  In "Considerations on the Government of Poland," Rousseau also writes, "It is not good that the sovereign should have too much power over the lives and property of the citizens." This passage shows his critique of excessive state power, a principle that is often associated with democracy.
    
15.  In "Considerations on the Government of Poland," Rousseau also writes, "The laws must be the same for all, whether it be to protect or to punish." This passage shows his emphasis on equality before the law, a principle that is often associated with democracy.

The above sentence referring to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political philosophy has been echoed by many historians who have suggested that his work contains elements of Socialism, Absolutism, and Democracy. 

Historian and author Christopher A. Bayly argued that Rousseau's works demonstrate a fusion of "absolutism and democracy, state-worship and popular sovereignty". Bayly wrote in his book, "Rousseau, Democracy, and the General Will", that, "Rousseau's thought is a fusion of the traditional values of absolutism and democracy, of state-worship and popular sovereignty, of the ancien régime and the Enlightenment." 

Historian and political scientist John Stuart Mill similarly argued that Rousseau's political philosophy is reflective of a combination of democratic elements and authoritarian elements. Mill wrote, “Rousseau’s political system, with its mixture of democracy and absolutism, is the nearest approach of any great writer to the truth on this subject.” 

Historian and author John Dunn suggested in his book, "The Political Thought of John Locke: An Historical Account of the Argument of the "Two Treatises of Government", that Rousseau's work contains elements of both absolutism and democracy. Dunn wrote, “did not Rousseau’s own political thought contain the seeds of both absolutism and democracy?” 

According to the historian and author Steven Lukes, Rousseau's political philosophy "prefigures the combination of democracy and socialism". Lukes wrote in his book, "Rousseau: A Theory of Freedom", that "Rousseau prefigures the combination of democracy and socialism which we have come to call social democracy" and that the "main thesis of The Social Contract is that only democratic government can guarantee man’s freedom." 

These historians have provided evidence that Jean-Jacques Rousseau's works contain elements of both Socialism, Absolutism, and Democracy. Christopher A. Bayly argued that Rousseau's works demonstrate a fusion of "absolutism and democracy", John Stuart Mill argued that Rousseau's political philosophy is reflective of a combination of democratic elements and authoritarian elements, John Dunn suggested Rousseau's work contains elements of both absolutism and democracy, and Steven Lukes stated that Rousseau prefigures the combination of democracy and socialism.

The quote "The promptings of the heart are more to be trusted than logic of the mind" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau is a reference to his belief in the importance of emotion and intuition over reason and logic in understanding the world and making decisions.

In his work "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men," Rousseau writes, "The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying This is mine, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society." He criticizes the society which relies on reason and logic to justify the concept of private property and the inequality that comes with it. This passage shows his belief that the promptings of the heart, or natural human emotions and instincts, can be more truthful than the logic of the mind in understanding the world.

In "Emile, or On Education," Rousseau also writes, "Nature made me happy and good, and if I am otherwise, it is society's fault." This passage shows his belief that natural human emotions and instincts are inherently good and that it is the corrupting influence of society that leads to moral decay.

However, it is important to note that Rousseau's statement that "The promptings of the heart are more to be trusted than logic of the mind" can be criticized as it can lead to a disregard for rationality and critical thinking. It also implies that emotions are always right and logical thinking is always wrong, which is not always the case. Rational thinking is important in decision making, especially in complex and uncertain situations.

Moreover, the idea that emotions are more trustworthy than reason can be problematic as it can lead to impulsive and irrational decision making, rather than carefully considered and logical decision making. Additionally, it can be argued that emotions can be influenced by biases and prejudices, which can lead to harmful or discriminatory actions.

1.  Historian J.G.A Pocock, in his book "The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition," argues that Rousseau's statement "The promptings of the heart are more to be trusted than logic of the mind" is a reflection of his romantic and sentimental approach to politics, which is in contrast with the rational and scientific approach of the early modern political thinkers. He writes, "Rousseau's emphasis on the moral and emotional impulses of the individual, as opposed to the intellectual and rational ones, is a product of his romanticism, which was in contrast to the rationalism of early modern political thought."
    
2.  Political theorist Hannah Arendt, in her book "The Origins of Totalitarianism," critiques Rousseau's statement as a justification for authoritarianism and totalitarianism. She writes, "Rousseau's glorification of the general will and the 'lawful' suppression of individual freedom can be seen as a precursor to the totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century."
    
3.  Political scientist Sheldon S. Wolin, in his book "Politics and Vision: Continuity and Innovation in Western Political Thought," argues that Rousseau's statement is an expression of his anti-modernism and his rejection of the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and individualism. He writes, "Rousseau's emphasis on the primacy of the general will and the suppression of individual freedom can be seen as a rejection of the modern emphasis on individual rights and democracy."
    
4.  Political theorist C.B. Macpherson, in his book "The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism: Hobbes to Locke," argues that Rousseau's statement is a reflection of his critique of capitalist society and the market economy. He writes, "Rousseau's emphasis on the primacy of the general will and the suppression of individual freedom can be seen as a critique of capitalist society and the market economy, which he viewed as corrupting and dehumanizing."

Jean-Jacques Rousseau's contract theory of government, as outlined in his work "The Social Contract," posits that the government's authority is derived from the consent of the governed. In this theory, individuals willingly give up some of their natural freedoms in exchange for protection and security provided by the government.

Rousseau believed that this social contract would reconcile the tension between the liberty of the individual and the institution of government by ensuring that the government only has as much power as the people are willing to grant it. He argued that in this way, the government would always be accountable to the people, and would be limited in its ability to infringe on individual rights.

However, some critics argue that Rousseau's contract theory is problematic because it assumes that all individuals have equal bargaining power and that the government will always act in the best interest of the people. In reality, individuals may have vastly different levels of power and resources, and the government may not always act in the public's best interest. Additionally, Rousseau's theory also overlooks the fact that people are not always rational and that they can be swayed by emotions and biases.

There are a number of historians who have offered both positive and negative evaluations of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's contract theory of government.

Some historians who have offered positive evaluations of Rousseau's contract theory include:

1.  C. B. Macpherson, who in his work "The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism" argues that Rousseau's theory provides a valuable critique of liberal political theory and offers a more participatory and democratic alternative.
    
2.  Leo Strauss, who in his work "The Social Contract" argues that Rousseau's theory represents a revolutionary break with traditional political thought and lays the foundation for modern political theory.
    
3.  J.G.A Pocock, who in his works argues that Rousseau's theory provides an important critique of modernity and the liberal tradition, and offers a more communitarian and republican alternative.
    
4.  David Miller, who in his work 'On Nationality' argues that Rousseau's theory is a key work in the history of political thought that can help us understand the relationship between nationalism and democracy.
    

On the other hand, there are also historians who have offered negative evaluations of Rousseau's contract theory, including:

1.  Isaiah Berlin, who in his work "Two Concepts of Liberty" argues that Rousseau's theory represents a form of authoritarianism that can lead to the suppression of individual freedom.
    
2.  Maurice Cranston, who in his work "The Solitude of Jean-Jacques Rousseau" argues that Rousseau's theory is impractical and unrealistic, and that it fails to take into account the complexity of human nature and political reality.
    
3.  Jean-Claude Michéa, who in his work "The Natural Contract" argues that Rousseau's theory is problematic because it assumes that people are fundamentally rational and that they can be persuaded to act in the common good, which is not the case in reality.
    
4.  J.C.D. Clark, who in his work "The Language of Liberty" argues that Rousseau's theory is inconsistent and contradictory, and that it ultimately leads to the erosion of individual rights and the rise of tyranny.

Contribution of Rousseau to Enlightenment

1.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau is known for his contributions to the Enlightenment through his political philosophy, which is outlined in his work "The Social Contract." In this book, he introduced the idea of the "general will," which is the idea that the collective will of the people should be the guiding principle in government and that the state should exist to serve the needs of the people. This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it challenges the traditional idea of absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.
    
2.  In "The Social Contract," Rousseau also introduced the idea of the "sovereign," a unified and absolute authority that represents the general will of the people and has the power to make laws and enforce them. This idea of an all-powerful sovereign is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it challenges the traditional idea of absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.
    
3.  In "The Social Contract," Rousseau also introduced the idea of social contract, where the people agree to give up some of their individual freedom in exchange for protection and security by the government, which is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it lays the foundation for the idea of democracy.
    
4.  In "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men," Rousseau critiques the idea of private property and the inequality that comes with it. He argues that the society which relies on reason and logic to justify the concept of private property is a corrupt society and it leads to inequality. This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it challenges the traditional idea of property and the social order.
    
5.  In "Emile, or On Education," Rousseau emphasizes the importance of education in shaping individuals and society. He argues that education should be based on the natural development of the individual and the cultivation of their natural talents and inclinations. This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it challenges traditional education which was based on rote learning and memorization.
    
6.  In "Confessions," Rousseau writes about his own life and experiences, and he reflects on the relationship between the individual and society. He argues that society corrupts the natural goodness of the individual, and that true freedom and happiness can only be found in a state of nature. This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it challenges traditional ideas of the relationship between the individual and society.
    
7.  In "Letter to M. D'Alembert on the Theater," Rousseau writes about the power of the arts to shape society and influence the people. He argues that the theater is a powerful means of educating the people and shaping public opinion. This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it emphasizes the role of arts in shaping society.
    
8.  In "Considerations on the Government of Poland," Rousseau argues that the laws must be the same for all, whether it be to protect or to punish. This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it emphasizes the principle of equality before the law.
    
9.  In "Considerations on the Government of Poland," Rousseau also writes, "It is not good that the sovereign should have too much power over the lives and property of the citizens." This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it criticizes excessive state power and lays the foundation for the idea of limited government.
    
10.  In "Considerations on the Government of Poland," Rousseau also writes, "The general will is always in the right and always tends towards the public good." This is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it emphasizes the importance of the collective will of the people in guiding the government and that the state should exist to serve the needs of the people. This principle is considered as an important contribution to the Enlightenment as it challenges traditional ideas of absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.

The Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, was an intellectual and cultural movement that emerged in the 18th century. It emphasized reason, science, and individualism, and sought to challenge traditional authority and institutions. Voltaire was a prominent figure of the Enlightenment and is known for his works that advocate for freedom of speech and religious tolerance.

Kant's statement can be interpreted as a criticism of the Enlightenment for not living up to its own ideals. He implies that while Voltaire and other Enlightenment thinkers advocated for reason and individualism, the society of the time was still plagued by superstition, intolerance, and oppression. The society of the time was not fully enlightened and did not fully embrace the values of the Enlightenment.

Furthermore, Kant's statement implies that the Enlightenment was not able to fully realize its ideals of reason and individualism, and that it failed to fully challenge traditional authority and institutions. For example, the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and science did not completely eradicate superstition and religious dogma. The ideas of individual rights and freedom of speech were not fully implemented and many people were still oppressed.

	In conclusion, Kant's statement is a critique of the Enlightenment for not living up to its own ideals of reason, science, and individualism. It highlights the limitations of the enlightenment, the society of the time was not fully enlightened and it failed to fully challenge traditional authority and institutions.

1. "For Kant, enlightenment is mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance and error." Critically examine. [2013, 20 Marks]

Kant's conception of enlightenment has been an influential idea for centuries, shaping the way we think about the development of the human species. Enlightenment for Kant is a process of freeing the human mind from its own subjective limitations, enabling it to exercise its capacity for reason and critical thinking. In this state, he argues, humans can finally come of age, no longer subject to the superstitious and oppressive forces of tradition or religion. 

However, Kant's view of enlightenment has been criticized for its emphasis on individual intellectual progress. Critics point to the communal and social aspects of enlightenment that are often overlooked, such as the need to work together to create a better society and to push against the political, economic and social structures that limit human development and freedom. Additionally, Kant's ideal of objective truth has been challenged in recent decades, as scholars have highlighted the importance of multiple perspectives, subjectivity and plurality in understanding the world.

In conclusion, Kant's conception of enlightenment as a process of individual emancipation from a state of ignorance and error provides an important foundation for reflecting on the development of human consciousness. However, it is important to consider the wider social and political context in which this enlightenment is being sought, and to recognize that there are multiple ways of understanding and engaging with the world.

Immanuel Kant's concept of enlightenment is central to his philosophy and can be found in his works "Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?" and "Critique of Pure Reason." Below points explain how Kant defines enlightenment as the "emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance and error":

1.  According to Kant, enlightenment is the process of "emergence from one's self-incurred immaturity." He argues that people are immature because they do not use their own reason but instead rely on the authority of others.
    
2.  Kant defines enlightenment as "the release of man from his self-incurred tutelage." He argues that people are in a state of tutelage because they allow themselves to be guided by others instead of using their own reason.
    
3.  Kant claims that enlightenment is the "dare to know" (Sapere Aude), the courage to think for oneself and to question authority.
    
4.  He asserts that people should "use their own understanding" (Reason) and not rely on the authority of others, such as tradition, religion, or the state.
    
5.  Kant argues that enlightenment is the process of moving from a state of "heteronomy" to "autonomy" where one is guided by their own reason rather than the authority of others.
    
6.  He states that enlightenment is the process of "maturity of the human being" where one is able to think for oneself, make informed decisions, and take responsibility for one's actions.
    
7.  Kant claims that enlightenment is the ability to "distinguish between one's own prejudices and the principles of reason"
    
8.  He states that enlightenment is the process of "the public use of one's reason" and that it is the "march of the human mind" towards greater understanding and knowledge.
    
9.  Kant argues that enlightenment is the process of "the emergence of the human being from his self-imposed nonage" where one is no longer a child, dependent on the authority of others.
    
10.  He claims that enlightenment is the condition for the "emancipation of the human being from the nonage of humanity" where one is able to think for oneself and make informed decisions.
    
In summary, for Kant, enlightenment is a process of self-emancipation where people use their own reason to question authority, think for themselves, and become mature and responsible individuals.

1. "Kant's redefinition of reason and his rehabilitation of conscience marked a high point in the intellectual reaction against dominant rationalism of the Enlightenment." Critically examine. [2017, 10 Marks]

Immanuel Kant's redefinition of reason and rehabilitation of conscience is considered a significant contribution to the intellectual reaction against the dominant rationalism of the Enlightenment.

The Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, emphasized the importance of reason and science in understanding the world and making decisions. However, Kant argues that reason alone is not sufficient for understanding the world and that it should be supplemented by other faculties such as intuition and imagination. In his Critique of Pure Reason, he writes "Reason is the faculty that enables us to think and understand things in a logical way, but it is not the only faculty we have."

Furthermore, Kant critiques the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and individualism, arguing that reason should be guided by moral principles. He rehabilitates the concept of conscience, or moral intuition, as a guide for moral decision making. In his Critique of Practical Reason, he writes "Reason must be guided by moral principles, and these principles are not derived from reason alone, but from conscience." This rehabilitation of conscience marked a high point in the intellectual reaction against the dominant rationalism of the Enlightenment as it emphasizes the importance of moral principles in decision making.

Additionally, Kant's philosophy also marked a high point in the intellectual reaction against the dominant rationalism of the Enlightenment as it challenges traditional authority and institutions. In his work "What is Enlightenment?" he writes "Enlightenment is the release of man from his self-incurred tutelage. Tutelage is man's inability to make use of his own understanding without the direction of another." This statement emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and autonomy and challenges traditional authority and institutions.

In conclusion, Kant's redefinition of reason and rehabilitation of conscience marked a high point in the intellectual reaction against the dominant rationalism of the Enlightenment. He emphasizes the importance of intuition, imagination and moral principles in understanding the world and making decisions, and challenges traditional authority and institutions.
