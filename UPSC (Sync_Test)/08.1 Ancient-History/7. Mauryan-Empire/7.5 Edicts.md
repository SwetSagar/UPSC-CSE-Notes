### 13th Major Rock Edict

When he had been consecrated eight years the Beloved of the Gods, the king Piyadassi, conquered Kalinga. A hundred and fifty thousand people were deported, a hundred thousand were killed and many times that number perished. Afterwards, now that Kalinga was annexed, the Beloved of the Gods very earnestly practised Dhamma, desired Dhamma, and taught Dhamma, On conquering Kalinga the Beloved of the Gods felt remorse, for, when an independent country is conquered the slaughter, death, and deportation of the people is extremely grievous to the Belovedof the Gods, and weighs heavily on his mind. What is even more deplorable to the Beloved of the Gods, is that those who dwell there, whether brahmans, sramanas, or those of other sects, or householders who show obedience to their superiors, obedience to mother and father, obedience to their teachers and behave well and devotedly towards their friends, acquaintances, colleagues, relatives, slaves, and servants - all suffer violence, murder, and separation from their loved ones. Even those who are fortunate to have escaped, and whose love is undiminished [by the brutalizingeffect of war], suffer from the misfortunes of their friends, acquaintances, colleagues, and relatives. This participation of all men in suffering, weighs heavily on the mind of the Beloved of the Gods. Except among the Greeks, there is no land where the religious orders of brahmanas and sramanasare not to be found, and there is no land anywhere where men do not support one sect or another. Today if a hundredth or a thousandth part of those people who were killed or died or were deported when Kalinga was annexed were to suffer similarly, it would weigh heavily on the mind of the Beloved of the Gods,

The Beloved of the Gods believes that one who does wrong should be forgiven as far as it is possible to forgive him. And the Beloved of the Gods conciliates the forest tribes of his empire, but he warns them that he has power even in his remorse and he asks them to repent, lest they be killed. For the Beloved of the Gods wishes that all beings should he unharmed, self-controlled, calm in mind, and gentle.

The Beloved of the Gods considers victory by Dhamma to be the foremost victory. And moreover the Beloved of the Gods has gained this victory on all his frontiers to a distance of six hundred yojanas [i.e.about 1500 miles], where reigns the Greek king named Antiochus, and beyond the realm of that Antiochus in the lands of the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonus, Magas, and Alexander; and in the south over the Colas and Pandyas as far as Ceylon. Likewise here in the imperial territories among the Greeks and the Kambojas, Nabhakas and Nabhapanktis, Bhojasand Pitinikas, Andhras and Parindas, everywhere the people follow the Beloved of the Gods' instructions in Dhamma. Even where the envoys of the Beloved of the Gods have not gone, people hear of his conduct according to Dhamma, his precepts and his instruction in Dhamma, and they follow Dhamma and will continue to follow it.

What is obtained by this is victory everywhere, and everywhere victory is pleasant. This pleasure has been obtained through victory by Dhamma yet it is but a slight pleasure, for the Beloved of the Gods only looks upon that as important in its results which pertains to the next world.

Ths inscription of Dhamma has been engraved so that any sons or great grandsons that I may have should not think of gaining newconquest, and in whatever victories they may gain should be satisfied with patienceand light punishment. They should only consider conquest by Dhamma to be a true conquest, and delight in Dhamma should be their whole delight, for this is of value in both this world and the next. [^1]

The Inscriptions of Ashoka are a series of edicts and inscriptions that were inscribed on rocks and pillars across the Mauryan Empire by the Indian emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. These inscriptions are an important source of information about the empire, its administration, and Ashoka's policies and reforms. Here are ten of the most significant inscriptions of Ashoka, along with a brief description of their content:

1.  Rock Edict I: This edict announces Ashoka's adoption of non-violence and his commitment to promoting moral values.
    
2.  Rock Edict II: This edict instructs all citizens to respect the teachings of the Buddha and to practice moral values such as non-violence and truthfulness.
    
3.  Rock Edict III: This edict calls for the protection of all living beings, including animals, and instructs all citizens to practice compassion and kindness.
    
4.  Rock Edict IV: This edict instructs the king's administrators to govern justly and to treat all citizens fairly and equitably.
    
5.  Rock Edict V: This edict announces Ashoka's personal involvement in the spread of Buddhism and his commitment to building Buddhist monasteries and providing support to Buddhist monks.
    
6.  Rock Edict VI: This edict instructs the king's administrators to maintain the public welfare and to provide aid to those in need.
    
7.  Rock Edict VII: This edict instructs the king's administrators to promote the welfare of all sects and to avoid discrimination based on religion or caste.
    
8.  Rock Edict VIII: This edict instructs the king's administrators to promote the growth of agriculture and commerce, and to encourage the spread of trade and commerce throughout the empire.
    
9.  Rock Edict IX: This edict calls for the protection of all forests and wildlife, and instructs the king's administrators to preserve the environment for future generations.
    
10.  Rock Edict X: This edict instructs the king's administrators to promote the welfare of all citizens, including women, children, and the elderly.
    

These inscriptions provide a valuable glimpse into the administration, policies, and reforms of Ashoka, and they serve as an important reminder of his commitment to ethical governance, compassion, and non-violence. They also demonstrate the extent of Ashoka's influence, as they were inscribed on rocks and pillars across a large portion of the Mauryan Empire, and they remain a significant part of India's cultural heritage to this day.
