```ad-Answer

The Maurya Empire, which was ruled by Emperor Ashoka and his descendants, was one of the largest and most powerful empires in ancient India. One of the key policies of the Maurya Empire was the regulation and control of economic activities. The Mauryan state was characterized by a highly centralized administration and a well-developed system of taxation and revenue collection.

One of the key components of the Mauryan policy of regulating and controlling economic activities was the implementation of a tax system. The Mauryans levied taxes on various sources of income, such as land, trade, and commerce. The taxes were collected by state officials and used to finance the administration, the army, and public works projects. In addition to taxes, the Mauryans also regulated trade and commerce, by setting tariffs and standards for goods, and by controlling the production and distribution of certain goods.

Another important aspect of the Mauryan policy of regulating and controlling economic activities was the promotion of agriculture. The Mauryans encouraged the cultivation of crops and the expansion of irrigation systems, which helped to increase agricultural productivity and provide food for the growing population. In addition to promoting agriculture, the Mauryans also encouraged the growth of trade and commerce, by building roads, ports, and other infrastructure that facilitated the movement of goods and people.

One of the most innovative aspects of the Mauryan policy of regulating and controlling economic activities was the creation of a standardized system of weights and measures. This system was used to regulate trade and commerce, and to prevent fraud and cheating in the marketplace. The Mauryans also established mints to produce standardized coins, which were used as a medium of exchange throughout the empire.

The Mauryan policy of regulating and controlling economic activities also had a significant impact on the development of the artisan and manufacturing industries. The Mauryans encouraged the growth of these industries, by providing subsidies and tax incentives, and by setting standards for the quality of goods produced. This helped to increase the production of goods, and to create jobs for the growing population.

```ad-Views

One of the most prominent historians to view Mauryan court art as an "alien grafting" was Ernst Waldschmidt, who argued that Mauryan art was heavily influenced by Hellenistic and Persian styles. He pointed to the use of Greek-style motifs and techniques, such as the depiction of animals and foliage in a naturalistic style, as evidence of this influence.

Another historian who views Mauryan court art as an "alien grafting" is Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, who argued that Mauryan art was heavily influenced by Hellenistic and Persian styles. He pointed to the use of Greek-style motifs and techniques, such as the depiction of animals and foliage in a naturalistic style, as evidence of this influence.

However, there are also scholars who do not view Mauryan court art as an "alien grafting." These scholars argue that Mauryan art was a unique fusion of different styles and techniques, reflecting the diversity of the Mauryan Empire. They point to the use of indigenous motifs and techniques, such as the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses, as evidence of this fusion.

One of the most prominent historians to argue against the "alien grafting" theory is Romila Thapar, who has argued that Mauryan art was not a foreign import, but was instead a reflection of the indigenous art traditions of India. She points to the use of indigenous motifs and techniques, such as the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses, as evidence of this indigenous influence.
