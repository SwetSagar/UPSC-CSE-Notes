1. "Ancient Indians had *no taste for historiography*; their scholars cared more for religious,spiritual and philosophical studies. Indian historiography is essentially an *Islamic heritage*." Comment upon this statement with ***special reference to the contemporary writers*** and their works which help us in the reconstruction of history of the **early medieval period** of Indian history. [1996, 60m]
- SSH material answer from page 8

```ad-Answer

The statement that ancient Indians had no taste for historiography is largely true, as the majority of Indian scholars during the ancient period focused on religious, spiritual, and philosophical studies. However, this does not mean that there was no historiography whatsoever in ancient India. Evidence of historiography can be seen in the Puranas, which are a collection of ancient Hindu texts, as well as in the Mahabharata and Ramayana epics. Moreover, some of the Vedic literature also contains elements of historiography.

However, it is true that Indian historiography has largely been an Islamic heritage. This is because the Islamic conquests brought with them a new style of historiography, which was not present in ancient India. This style of historiography was based on the Arabic and Persian traditions of writing history, and it was adopted by Indian scholars and writers who were influenced by Islamic culture and religion.

The Islamic style of historiography was very different from the ancient Indian style. It was more analytical and focused on describing events in a chronological order. It also provided more details about the events, such as the names of the people involved, their motivations, and the consequences of their actions.

Chronicles: These include works such as the "Rajatarangini" written by Kalhana, the "Prithviraj Raso" written by Chand Bardai, and the "Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh" written by Hasan Nizami. These chronicles provide valuable information about the political history of the period, including the rise and fall of dynasties, wars and battles, and the reigns of individual kings.

Works such as ChachNama, Khitab ul Hind of Alberuni, Hasan Nizam's Taaj ul Maasir, Minhaz al Siraj's Tabaghat i Nasiri etc help in reconstructing the Early Medieval Indian History.

1. Discuss the changing approaches to the study of early Indian history. [2006, 60m]

	- **Ans :** Orientology - Nationalist historiography - Marxist Historiography - Palaeo environmental/Feminist/Sub A [[1.2 Literary Sources#Historiography]]]]
	- SSH material answer from page 26

```ad-Answer

The study of early Indian history has undergone several changes in approach over time. Some of the key changes include:

1.  Colonial-era approach: In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the study of Indian history was largely influenced by the colonial perspective. Historians of this era, such as James Mill, saw Indian history as a linear progression from a primitive past to a more advanced present under British rule.
    
2.  Nationalist approach: In the early 20th century, Indian nationalists began to reject the colonial perspective and instead emphasized the continuity and greatness of Indian civilization. This approach emphasized the achievements of ancient India and the continuity of Indian civilization through the ages.
    
3.  Marxist approach: In the mid-20th century, historians such as D. D. Kosambi and R. S. Sharma began to adopt a Marxist approach to the study of Indian history. This approach emphasized the role of economic and class factors in shaping Indian history and society.
    
4.  Subaltern approach: In the late 20th century, historians such as Ranajit Guha began to focus on the history of marginalized groups, such as peasants and lower castes, and the ways in which they resisted and negotiated power.
    
5.  Post-colonial approach: More recently, historians have begun to adopt a post-colonial perspective, which emphasizes the ways in which power and knowledge are constructed and contested, and the role of colonialism in shaping Indian history and society.
    
6.  Multi-disciplinary approach: In recent years, there has been an increasing effort to integrate multiple disciplines, such as archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics, and literary studies to understand early Indian history.
    
7.  Gender and social history: In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on understanding the history of women and marginalized communities, as well as the ways in which gender, caste, class, religion, and other factors have shaped the experiences of different groups in Indian history.
    
These changing approaches have led to a more nuanced and complex understanding of early Indian history, and have helped to move away from the earlier Eurocentric and colonial perspectives.

```ad-Answer

Early inscriptions and literature provide valuable insight into the status of women in the politico-socio-economic spheres of early medieval India.

Inscriptions, such as copper plate grants and temple inscriptions, reveal that women were able to own property and make gifts and donations to religious institutions. Some inscriptions also mention the names of women who held important administrative and economic positions, such as village headwoman, or held high-ranking positions in court. This indicates that women were not entirely excluded from public life and had some degree of autonomy and agency.

Literature, such as the epics and plays, also provide insight into the status of women in early medieval India. They depict women as capable and intelligent individuals who were able to make significant contributions to society, such as in the case of the character of Draupadi in the Mahabharata. These literary sources also reflect the existence of a patriarchal society, where women were expected to conform to traditional gender roles and were often subject to the control and authority of men.

However, it is important to note that these sources may not always accurately reflect the lived experiences of women, as they are often written by men, and may be influenced by the biases and perspectives of the authors.

```ad-Answer

1.  According to literary and epigraphic sources, land ownership in ancient India was primarily held by the ruling elite, including kings, nobles, and priests.
2.  The concept of private ownership of land was not fully developed, and land was often considered a royal resource to be allocated for the benefit of the state.
3.  Land grants were commonly given to Brahmins, temples and monasteries as a form of religious endowment, called "devadana" and "bhoga".
4.  Land grants were also given to individuals as a form of reward for services rendered to the state, such as military service.
5.  The land tax system was based on the assessment of the land's productivity, and the state collected revenue from land through the imposition of taxes and tributes.
6.  The system of land ownership and taxation varied across different regions and time periods, but the ruling elite generally held significant control over land and its resources.

Examples of Important Inscriptions that mention about land donations.

1. How far can the ancient Indian Sruti literature be used as historical sources? [2015, 15m]
- SSH material answer from page 39
- [[#What are the problems associated with Vedas as source of history?]]

```ad-Answer

Sruti literature, also known as Shruti, refers to the sacred texts of Hinduism that are considered to have been revealed or "heard" by ancient sages known as Rishis. The word "Sruti" literally means "what is heard" in Sanskrit, and the texts are considered to be the primary source of knowledge and authority in the Hindu tradition.

The Sruti literature includes the four Vedas (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvaveda), the Upanishads, and the Brahmanas. The Vedas are considered to be the most ancient and sacred texts and are divided into four collections: the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda. These texts are composed in the form of hymns and were used in religious rituals and ceremonies. The Upanishads are a collection of philosophical texts that are considered to be the end of the Vedas and the Brahmanas are texts that provide commentaries and explanations of the Vedas.

Sruti literature is considered to be of divine origin, and it is considered to be the foundation of the Hindu religious tradition. They are considered to be apauruseya or texts that are not of human origin and are considered to be eternal and unchanging. The texts are considered to be a source of knowledge and authority in the Hindu tradition and continue to be widely studied and revered to this day.

Ancient Indian Sruti literature can be used as historical sources to a certain extent, but it's important to keep in mind that they were primarily composed for religious and spiritual purposes, rather than for recording historical events. The Sruti literature includes texts such as the Vedas, which are considered to be the most ancient and sacred texts of Hinduism, as well as the Upanishads and the Brahmanas. These texts provide valuable information about the religious beliefs and practices of ancient India and are considered to be an important source of information on the cultural and intellectual history of ancient India.

However, when it comes to historical facts, Sruti literature is not entirely reliable, as the texts were passed down orally for centuries before they were written down. This means that the texts may have undergone changes and modifications over time. Additionally, Sruti literature is not always specific about the time and place of events, so it can be difficult to determine the historical accuracy of the texts.

Sruti literature also reflects the worldview and cultural context of the society in which it was composed and therefore, it may not be completely objective. In other words, the texts may contain elements of mythology, legend, and other forms of creative expression that are not historically accurate.

The early Indian historical tradition, as reflected in the Itihasa-Purana genre, emerged during the period of the Vedic civilization in ancient India. Itihasa and Purana are two separate but related genres of Indian literature that were composed between c. 1000 BCE and c. 500 CE.

Itihasa, also known as "history" or "legend", is a genre of literature that narrates the past events of ancient India. The most famous examples of Itihasa are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. These texts are considered to be a combination of myth, legend, and historical fact and were composed in the form of epic poetry. They deal with the deeds of great kings, heroes, and gods and are considered to be an important source of information about the cultural, social, and political aspects of ancient India.

Purana, which means "ancient" or "old," is a genre of literature that narrates the stories of gods, goddesses, and other divine entities. The Puranas are divided into two categories: the "Sattvika Puranas" which are devoted to the worship of Vishnu and his avatars, and the "Tamasika Puranas" which are devoted to the worship of Shiva and Devi. The Puranas are also a source of information on cosmology, genealogy, geography, and other aspects of ancient Indian culture.

The distinctive features of the Itihasa-Purana genre include:

-   They deal with stories of gods, goddesses, kings, heroes, and other figures from Indian mythology
-   They are composed in the form of epic poetry and include elements of mythology, legend, and history
-   They provide valuable information about the cultural, social, and political aspects of ancient India
-   They are an important source of information on Indian religion, philosophy, and cosmology
-   They have played a significant role in shaping the cultural and religious identity of India and continue to be widely read and studied to this day.

- Marxist scholars like R.S.Sharma, BNS Yadav and the likes view early medieval polity as one of decentralization and disintegration and the emergence and crystallisation of Indian feudalism.
- Feudalism debate in Indian context started by Col. James Todd seeing it as a lord vassal relationship
- D D Kosmabi gave feudalism a significant place in the context of socio-economic history in his book An Introduction to the Study of Indian History as the land grants increased so did the no of landlords from villages and towns
- RS Sharma has shown that the decline in trade and commerce and the deurbanisation and the fall of the gupta empire, debasement of coins all led to the inc in land grants and thereby feudalism during this time. He refined his views in his paper How Feudal was Indian Feudalism? to include the economic and social crises.
- D.N.Jha has conc on the cultural and ideological dimensions for the rise of feudalism in his The Feudal order in his book The Feudal Order
- In the reconstruction of early medieval polity 3 models are at present accepted :
	- unitary, centrally organized kingdom with a strong central bureaucracy
	- Indian Feudalism model of decentralized feudal states
	- model of a segmentary state
- KN Sastri has shown that the Chola state was a juxtaposition of a powerful central monarchy and local administrative bodies.
- Burton Stein located the segmentary polity from Pallava times and has shown the difference b/w ritual sovereignty and actual political control.
