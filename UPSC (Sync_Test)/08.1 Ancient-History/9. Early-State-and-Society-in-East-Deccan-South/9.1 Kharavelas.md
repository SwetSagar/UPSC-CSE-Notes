Kharavela was a significant ruler of Kalinga, who reigned during the 2nd century BCE. During his reign, he undertook various militaristic activities, making a number of successful expeditions.

He defeated many powers like Magadhan rulers from eastern India, Panchanana of the southern Andhra country, and Pishtikapura of Vidvesvara of the Ahicchatra region. He also received valuable items in his military conquests such as the nine gems of Ujjain and the Jyotirlinga Sivalinga. He was also successful in defeating the eastern vangas and recovered the royal umbrella of the kalingas. He also destructed the citadel of the conch-bearing Yavana troops that had been bothering Kalinga for years.

Kharavela reign is significant not only for his military exploits but also for his importance in Indian culture and literature. During his reign, the Hathigumpha inscriptions were written, providing valuable historical information on his reign. He patronized Buddhism and supported Jain literature, which helped to spread religion and philosophy in the region. He had also established various coastal ports in Kalinga, which improved trading and boosted the Indian economy.

His use of peaceful diplomacy, strong trade relations, and patronage of Indian religion and philosophy are all major contributions made by Kharavela to India. As a result, Kharavela’s reign has had a profound effect on Indian history and culture, and will continue to have an important place in Indian history.
