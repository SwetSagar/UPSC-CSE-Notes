```ad-Answer

The status of women in India from c. 4th century BC to c. 6th century AD was not uniform or static, but varied according to the social, religious, economic, and political factors of different periods and regions. However, a general trend of decline in the status of women can be observed in this period, as compared to the earlier Vedic period, when women enjoyed more rights and freedoms.

In the c. 4th century BC, India witnessed the rise of the Mauryan empire, which was influenced by the teachings of Buddhism and Jainism. These religions advocated non-violence, compassion, and equality, and gave women some opportunities for education, religious participation, and social service. Some women, such as the Mauryan emperor Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitra, became prominent Buddhist missionaries and monks. However, women were still subordinate to men in the family and society, and had to follow the norms of chastity, obedience, and modesty. Women were also subject to the practice of child marriage, polygamy, and dowry, which reduced their autonomy and dignity.

In the c. 1st century BC to c. 3rd century AD, India witnessed the rule of the Kushanas and the Satavahanas, who were influenced by the culture and trade of the Greeks, Romans, and Central Asians. These contacts exposed women to new ideas, arts, and crafts, and gave them some scope for economic activity and social mobility. Some women, such as the Satavahana queen Naganika, became influential patrons of literature and religion. However, women were still dependent on men for their status and security, and had to conform to the patriarchal and Brahmanical values of the society. Women were also subject to the practice of sati, or widow immolation, which reflected the low status and value of women.

In the c. 4th century AD to c. 6th century AD, India witnessed the rule of the Gupta empire, which is considered to be the golden age of Indian culture and civilization. This period saw the flourishing of literature, science, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and art, and gave women some opportunities for learning and creativity. Some women, such as the poet Kalidasa's wife Malavika, became renowned for their literary and artistic talents. However, women were still confined to the domestic sphere and the roles of wives and mothers, and had to follow the strict codes of conduct and morality prescribed by the law books, such as the Manusmriti.
