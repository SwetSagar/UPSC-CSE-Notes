Q. Explain the meaning of the word Protohistory in various contexts?

- Europeans : People who did not themselves have **writing** but are mentioned in **written texts**.
- India : Refers to Harappan period and from 1500-500 BCE during which only literature was orally transmitted.
- Archaeologist : refers to period b/w beginning of food production and advent of Iron Tech include Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures
- beginning of double cropping can be traced at sites like **Pirak** in Baluchistan.
- Multiple cropping was carried out in the **Kachi** plain, Gujarat and Maharahstra.

## Neolithic

- origins of agriculture and beginnings of domestication of animals. Transformation from hunting and gathering to sedentary farming leading to village settlements and manufacturing of new type of tools was called as neolithic age.
- Term was coined by Sir John Lubbock in his book Prehistoric Times it meant where stones were more skilfully made. Later **V. Gordon Childe defined the Neolithic-Chalcolithic culture as a selfsufficient food producing economy**
- Features of this age were - Practice of **agriculture, Domestication of animals, Grinding polishing of stone tools** (most essential characterstic of Neo culture), and also the **manufacture of pottery**
- 6000 BC began Neolithic and as late as 1000BC in south and Eastern IN
- Used polished stone tools
- Produced Ragi and Horsegram, later rice wheat and barley
- Hand made potter in early phase, later in

### Beginning of Neolithic Age in and around the World

- areas of **wadi Kubbaiya, Wadi Tuska, Kom Umbo** near the Nile valley have given the earliest evidences of cultivation of barley and wheat.
- Not all the sites were neolithic sites some may have preceded neolithic culture. Domestication of animal also came after food cultivation. Thus it can be said that domestication of plants did not originate in West Asia
- **farming began in Palestine, Syria and Turkey** in the 9th millennium B.C.
- Between 8500-7500 B.C. **Jericho in Palestine** became large village where agriculture is evidenced but there is **no evidence of animal domestication**. It was a **fortified** settlement.
- **Catal Huyuk in Southern Turkey** was a large village. Here wheat, barley and peas were grown. Animals like cattle, sheep and goat were domesticated. Wall murals in mud houses can also be seen.
- In Iraq at **Jarmo** there is also evidence of permanently established farming villages I (6500-5800 B.C.) with about 20 to 30 mud houses
- In Iran farming began in the region of **Khuzistan** during eight millennium B.C., almost I the same time as in Palestine and Anatolia.
- At Ali Kosh in South Iran (from about I 7,500 B.C.) we have the evidence of a winter camp

### Neolithic Sites in the Sub Continent

- Neo levels **Mehrgarh** classified into two phases, (i) early **aceramic** w/o pottery and (ii) the later phase
- domestication of sheep goat done locally. beginning of the pre-pottery settlement phase has been fixed to about 6000 B.C.
- rectangular houses of mud-bricks some structures were which were used for storage
- N culture of Burzahom displays affinities w/ Sarai Khola, Ghaligai of Swat valley in pottery, bone and stone objects. Pit dwellings, harvesters and dog burials are characteristics of the North Chinese Neolithic culture. Contact with the pre-Harappans is also indicated by the pottery found at Burzahom
- relevant excavated sites of the Belan Valley which indicate transition from the food-gathering stage to the food producing stage are Chopani-Mando, Koldihawa and Mahagara.
- Chopani-Mando provides the **earliest evidence of the use of pottery** in the world.
- Neolithic culture of South India has been placed between 2600 and 1000 B.C.
- **Millet** (Ragi) was one of the earliest crops cultivated by the Neolithic farmers of South India. Other crops were wheat, horsegram, and moong (green gram).
- at Nagarjunakonda that domestication of plants preceded the domestication of animals
- No neolithic phase has been found in the upper reaches of the Krishna and the Godavari and their tributaries and But the evidence from Chandoli on the Bhima, a tributary of the Krishna and from Nevasa and Daimabad suggest they moved to chalcolithic phase.
- Only a few neolithic sites have been found in n the Tapti and Narmada valleys of north Maharashtra, MP and Gujarat.

## Chalcolithic

- Chalcolithic cultural sequence in doab includes late Harappan phase, the **OCP culture**, Copper Hoards and **Black and Red Ware BRW** phase
- 1800 - 1000/800 BC
- Used small tools esp stone blade, situated closer to hills
- BRW wheel made, linear designs
- Channel spouted pots, dishes and bowls on stand
- Bajra, Lentil, Black gram, green gram, grass pea, cotton, ragi, bajra
- Mud brick houses, wattle daub,
- Jorwe culture - nucleated settlements,
- Village economy
- first to use painted pottery
- Burials in Maharashtra in North South position, in South in East West
- Limitations - Burials had large no of children, rural background, supply of metal was limited, no writing, did not benefit from IVC
- Concentrated on the Ganga Yamuna doab, Ochre coloured pottery found, Anthropomorphic figures in Khetri mines

Archaeological materials are essential for understanding the progress of Neolithic man in India. Neolithic man was the first human species to begin using stone tools and to develop agriculture in the region. Archaeological materials provide evidence of the lifestyle, culture, technology, and subsistence strategies of Neolithic man in India. 

Archaeological materials provide direct evidence of the tools and objects used by Neolithic man in India. These artifacts include **stone tools, pottery, and jewelry**. 

**Stone tools** are the earliest evidence of Neolithic man in India, and they provide insight into the types of activities they were engaged in. For example, stone tools have been found in the Deccan region of India that date back to the Middle and Late Neolithic period. These tools include axes, scrapers, and hammerstones, which indicate that Neolithic man was engaging in activities such as hunting and gathering, as well as woodworking and stone tool production.

**Pottery** is another type of archaeological material that provides insight into the lifestyle of Neolithic man in India. Pottery was first produced during the Neolithic period in India, and it is believed to have been used for a variety of purposes. Pottery has been found in the Deccan region of India that dates back to the Middle and Late Neolithic period. The pottery found in this region is decorated with geometric patterns and human figures, indicating that Neolithic man was engaging in activities such as ritual and religious practices.

**Jewelry** is another type of archaeological material that provides insight into the lifestyle of Neolithic man in India. Jewelry was first produced during the Neolithic period in India, and it is believed to have been used for a variety of purposes. Jewelry has been found in the Deccan region of India that dates back to the Middle and Late Neolithic period. The jewelry found in this region includes beads, pendants, and rings, which indicate that Neolithic man was engaging in activities such as trade and exchange, as well as rituals and religious practices.

**Archaeological materials** provide insight into the subsistence strategies of Neolithic man in India. Archaeological evidence indicates that Neolithic man in India was primarily engaged in hunting and gathering, as well as the cultivation of crops. In the Deccan region of India, archaeologists have found evidence of the cultivation of millets, pulses, and other crops, as well as the domestication of animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. This evidence indicates that Neolithic man in India was engaging in activities such as agriculture and animal husbandry.

The Chalcolithic pottery of India provides a valuable window into the lives of the people who lived during this period. The pottery reveals a variety of motifs, shapes and sizes, which indicate the level of craftsmanship and skill of the potters. The motifs on the pottery often reflect the beliefs, customs and values of the people, and can provide clues about their social structure and religious practices. In addition, the pottery can give us an idea of the types of food and drinks that were consumed, as well as the tools and materials used for various tasks.

However, the pottery alone is not enough to give us a full picture of the Chalcolithic period. Without written records, it is difficult to accurately interpret the meaning of the motifs and to understand the context in which the pottery was used. Furthermore, the pottery only reveals a limited amount of information about the people’s daily lives and their interactions with the environment. Thus, while the pottery of the Chalcolithic period can help us to gain a better understanding of the culture and life styles of the people of that time, it is only one piece of the puzzle.

In the North-West region of India, the Neolithic period is characterized by the presence of the Mehrgarh culture, which existed from around 7000 BCE to 2500 BCE. Mehrgarh is considered to be one of the earliest sites of settled agriculture in the region and the people of Mehrgarh were skilled in agriculture, animal husbandry, and craftsmanship. They also developed a system of irrigation for their crops.

In the South India, the Neolithic period is marked by the presence of the Ashmound culture, which existed from around 2500 BCE to 1500 BCE. The Ashmound people were semi-nomadic and relied mainly on hunting and gathering, but also practiced some agriculture. They were also skilled in crafting tools and weapons from stone and bone.

In the Western India, the Neolithic period is characterized by the presence of the Sothi-Siswal culture, which existed from around 4500 BCE to 3500 BCE. The Sothi-Siswal people were primarily engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. They also developed pottery and metalworking.

In the South India, the Neolithic period is marked by the presence of the Kupgal culture, which existed from around 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The Kupgal people were primarily engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. They also developed pottery and metalworking.

In Eastern India, the Neolithic period is marked by the presence of the ---- culture, which existed from around 3000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The ---- people were primarily engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. They also developed pottery and metalworking.

1. The emergence of Non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures in Central India and the Deccan mark a change not only in the subsistence pattern of people but an overall transition from pre to proto historic period. Critically analyze. [2017, 15 Marks]
- Refer ANKI : Chalcolithic Sites

```ad-Answer

The emergence of Non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures in Central India and the Deccan (also known as the Late Stone Age) mark a significant change in the subsistence patterns of the people and an overall transition from the pre-historic to proto-historic period.

One of the most notable changes during this period was the shift from a hunting and gathering lifestyle to a settled agricultural one. The people of the Non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures in Central India and the Deccan began to cultivate crops like barley, wheat, and lentils, and also domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, and cattle. This shift towards agriculture led to the emergence of small-scale village communities and the development of new technologies such as irrigation systems and ploughs.

Another notable change during this period was the development of metallurgy. The people of the Non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures in Central India and the Deccan began to extract and work with copper and other metals, which led to the emergence of new tools and weapons, and also new forms of trade and exchange.

The emergence of these cultures also marks a transition from pre-historic to proto-historic period, as people began to develop more complex forms of social organization and administration. There is also evidence of religious practices, as well as the emergence of new forms of art and craftsmanship.

Farming cultures outside the Indus system were vital to the development of the pre and proto historic period. These cultures were spread across a variety of geographical regions, from the Middle East to South Asia and beyond. They were important in terms of providing food, resources, and labor to the societies of the time.

The earliest farming cultures outside the Indus system date back to the Neolithic period, around 12,000 BCE. These cultures are often referred to as the “Fertile Crescent” cultures, due to the geographic region in which they were located. This region included the modern-day countries of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel. These cultures developed a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, and lentils, and began to domesticate animals such as sheep and goats. This allowed them to develop more advanced agricultural techniques and to produce more food than ever before.

Farming cultures outside the Indus system were also important in terms of trade. These cultures were able to trade with other regions, such as the Indus Valley, and this allowed for the spread of goods and ideas across vast distances. This trade was especially important for the development of the Bronze Age, as it allowed for the spread of bronze and other metals across the region.

In addition to trade, these farming cultures also played a role in the development of religion. Many of the beliefs and practices of the ancient Middle East were based on agricultural cycles, such as the cycle of the seasons and the cycle of fertility. This allowed for the development of complex religious systems, such as those found in the religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Farming cultures outside the Indus system have also been found in many different regions, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and the Americas. 

In Mesopotamia, the Sumerians were the first to develop a sophisticated system of agriculture. The Sumerians used irrigation to maximize crop yield and built large-scale irrigation systems to support their farming efforts. They also developed new techniques for crop rotation, which allowed them to maximize their land's productivity. The Sumerians also developed a complex system of writing, which allowed them to record their agricultural knowledge and practices. This allowed them to pass down their farming techniques to future generations. 

In Egypt, the ancient Egyptians developed a sophisticated system of irrigation and crop rotation, as well as a system of writing. They also developed a system of taxation and land ownership, which allowed them to control the production and distribution of agricultural products. The Egyptians also developed a complex system of government, which allowed them to manage the large-scale agricultural production of the region. 

In China, the ancient Chinese developed a system of agriculture that was based on the principles of Taoism. They developed a system of terracing and irrigation that allowed them to maximize crop yield. The Chinese also developed a system of writing, which allowed them to record their agricultural knowledge and practices. They also developed a system of taxation and land ownership, which allowed them to control the production and distribution of agricultural products. 

In the Americas, the ancient Mayans and Aztecs developed sophisticated systems of agriculture. The Mayans developed a system of terracing and irrigation that allowed them to maximize crop yield. They also developed a complex system of writing, which allowed them to record their agricultural knowledge and practices. The Aztecs developed a system of taxation and land ownership, which allowed them to control the production and distribution of agricultural products. 

Farming cultures outside the Indus system have had a significant impact on the development of human civilization. These cultures developed sophisticated systems of irrigation, crop rotation, taxation, and land ownership that allowed them to maximize crop yield and control the production and distribution of agricultural products. These systems allowed them to pass down their agricultural knowledge and practices to future generations, which allowed them to further develop and refine their agricultural practices. 

The development of these farming cultures outside the Indus system has had a profound impact on the development of human civilization, and their contributions are still evident today.
