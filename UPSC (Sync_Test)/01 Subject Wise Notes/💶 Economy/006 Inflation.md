- When inflation rises to very high levels it causes negative effects thus gov policies aim at growth with price stability ie moderate inflation on a long term basis

## Types of Inflation

- Creeping inflation upto 4%,
- Trotting inflation - 4-8%,
- Galloping Inflation 8-10%,
- Runaway inflation 10-20%,
- Hyperinflation - 20-30% result of reckless fiscal policy
- **Deflation**
	- prolonged decline in prices spending dec as people wait for prices to fall further
	- ==inflation rate falls below 0% ie negative inflation,== increases the value of money, associated with recession
	- self reinforcing so difficult to check
	- to curb it tax cuts, lower repo, print more currency, capital injection, inc gov spending
- **Disinflation**
	- rate of growth of prices slows, ==opposite of reflation==
	- inflation returns after deflation or recession.
	- To curb it
		- Tax cuts to boost demand, inc gov spending
		- Lower interest rate to encourage lending, print more currency
- **Stagflation** : inflation + unemployment
- **Open inflation** : gov does not suppress inflation with subsidies and monetary policy opposite is suppressed inflation
- **Headline inflation** : measure of total inflation, consumers face this
- **Core or Underlying inflation** : long running trend in general price levels, fuel, food, processed food etc are also included. But in Base inflation such items that show short term fluctuation are not included

### What Causes Inflation

**Pre 1970s people believed there were 2 reasons for it**

*Demand pull inflation*

- caused due to more money in economy, wage inflation, growth etc
- [[001 Economy and Economics#^1c427e|Real GDP]] also rises
- too much money chasing too few goods

*Cost Push inflation*

- cost of production goes up
- ex high prices of goods, high interest rates, high cost of capital

*Structural inflation*

- specific to sectors like agri, infra related inflation
- persistent, could be caused from inefficient distribution, backward tech etc

#### Various other Causes of Inflation is

- speculation in commodity exchanges
- cartelisation of producers
- Hoarding : causes artificial scarcity, checked by [[2.1 Govt Policies and Intervention in sectors#^eec400|Essential Commodities Act]]
- imported inflation
- global crude oil prices
- rupee depreciation
- higher MSP
- not meeting fiscal deficit target

**Measures to check Inflation**

- *Demand side measures* consumers are appealed to cut back consumption of items that show higher risk aka austerity this measure generally fails.
- *Supply side measures* aimed at increasing supply of items showing inflation this is a medium to long term strategy
- *Cost side measures* cutting taxes or cutting cost of production.

## How to Measure Inflation

### WPI

- sale of goods to *anyone other than consumer* is wholesale, includes logistics, cost of credit, warehousing cost, transport cost etc
- aka transaction at first point of bulk sale in domestic market
- Different goods have diff weightage
- it checks inflation from the perspective of the wholesale mandis.
- *published by Mo Commerce w/ base year as 2011-12*, updated monthly
- Divided into **primary articles; fuel, power; & mfd goods**
- **Seasonality** factor is considered
- Uses
	- timely intervention esp in essential commodities
	- used by Gov, Global Domestic investors for investment decisions
- Limitations
	- Accuracy is unsatisfactory as Services like education, telecom, rail, road, healthcare etc is not considered
	- Unorganised sector products not included
- New WPI
	  - 697 items increased quotations,
	- not include indirect taxes,
	- separate WPI Food Index
	- now closer to Producer Price Index PPI
	- item level aggregates compiled using geometric mean
	- New Wholesale Food Price Index has been introduced that combines Food Articles (primary food articles) to Food Products (manufactured).
	- Technical Review Committee TRC set up to review products.
- Useful for industrialists

### **CPI**

- change in retail level, can be whole or group specific like for industrial workers (IW) etc.
- DA and Wage is based on this index, considers Services as well
- CPI - IW, Agri Labourers, Rural Labourers RL, Urban, Rural and Combined
	- CPI IW is used a [[#Cost of Living index]] for organised sector, pay revisions for workers in Industry is based on this.
	- CPI Combined for inflation mgt by RBI
- CPI - UNME (Urban Non Manual Employees) and is used to determine Dearness Allowance DA of employees of some foreign companies operating in India. Has been discontinued and replaced by CPI - Urban.
- New CPI 2015 **by CSO, MOSPI**
	- base year has been changed to 2012
	- Pan, Tobacco and intoxicants made a different gro
	- Groups inc to six, tobacco, egg made separate sub-group.
	- Only transaction prices taken, electronic validation of data
	- Price of PDS items under Antyodaya Anna Yojana has also been included for compilation of indices under PDS items.
- Food inflation is reflected more in CPI vis WPI, RBI uses it
- Vary from place to place, WPI is same throughout country
- Some services like hotels, financing, trade, insurance not covered
- When food and energy prices are omitted from CPI remaining basket is commonly referred to as core CPI. Including them it is called Headline CPI.
- NSO, MoSPI publishes the data.

### Producer Price Index

- Is a better measure of inflation in comparison to WPI and CPI.
- It can be used to check if the retail prices in the future is going to increase or not.
- price at which producer sells to wholesale/distributor
- 2 types input and output
- fluctuation of prices of goods received by producer **excluding tax**, **transport and trade margin** is input
- Output is avg change in price of goods and services as they leave place of production

### Other Measures of Inflation

 [[001 Economy and Economics#GDP deflator|GDP deflator]] : most comprehensive, measures change in prices of all goods. For all domestically produced final goods and services.

**Cost of Living index** : goods required to maintain standard of living is tracked to check affordability. Released by Economic Intelligence Unit.

**Food Price Index** : CSO releases Consumer FPIs (CFPIs), FAO FPI by UN, WPI Food index by DPIIT

**NHB RESIDEX** - Indias official Housing price index by NHB 50 cities and 18 states, tracks price of house.
	- Can be used to check if broker is quoting higher price for hosue
	- Banks, housing finance bodies would be able to estimate if loans applications are realistic or not.

RBI puts out **House Price Index HPI** - quarterly for 10 major cities

**Service Price Index** : There is no index to measure price changes in the service sector.

## Impact of Inflation

- Inflation discourages exports, low growth rate - due to low investment, savings devalue, fiscal deficit increases
- Particularly hits people in low income brackets, fixed income individuals
- Inflation tax - hidden tax
- Small amt of inflation creates demand is good, greases the wheel
- Investment in economy is boosted due to higher inflation since it suggest higher demand and also due to lower cost of loan.
- In short term savings increase but in long term higher inflation depletes savings rate.
- Bracket creep or inflation induces tax increases where income of individuals move to higher tax bracket but real value of money doe not inc but falls.
- *Inflation makes foreign goods costlier and imports too*

**Optimal Inflation**

- for consumers is negative but not good for economy
- Monetary Policy Agreement b/w RBI and GOI 2015 - objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability, growth, contain CPI within 4% (+-2%)

## Analysis of Inflation in India

- India faces structural inflation that arises due to shortfall in supply of goods that does not match the rising demand.
- Cost Push inflation as price of goods and services has been rising due to higher import duties on raw materials.
- Recourse to heavy internal borrowing and printing of fresh currency to finance fiscal deficit.

**Steps taken by Gov to control inflation :**

- periodic reviews by Cabinet Committee on Prices CCP
- Reduced import on food items, Raising imports on gold etc
- Ban of export of food items, De-hoarding
- Advising state to allow free movt of fruits vegetables delisting them from APMC
- MPC adopted

## Definitions

**Inflationary Gap** : Excess of total govt spending above the natonal income is known as inflationary gap -> done to inc producton level that pushes the prices up.

- Thus increasing salaries of govt employees, enhancing MSP of notified agriculture commodities will lead to inc in govt expenditure it will create more demand in the economy.
- Sucking out the money from economy will reduce the gap.
- ==It measures the difference b/w current level of real GDP and GDP that would exist if any economy was operating at full employment.== #concept
- If real GDP is higher then the gap is termed as inflationary.
**Deflationary gap** is shorfall in total spending over national income production is more than the demand and a slowdown occurs aka *output gap*.

**Open Inflation** : when Gov does not suppress inflation, market forces instead influence it.

**Inflation tax** : Inflation erodes the value of currency and those who hold currency suffer. It looks as if inflation is working as a tax **aka seigniorage.**

**Inflation accounting** : due to inflation profit of companies get overstated when a firm calculates profits adjusting the side effects of inflation.

**Inflationary spiral** is b/w wages and prices where wages push prices up and prices pull wages up.

**Inflation permium** : Inflation causes borrowers joy and lenders grief the bonus to borrowers is known as inflation premium.

**Suppressed** is the opposite of it done through fiscal and monetary actions it does not resolve the issue.

**Inflation targeting** can best be achieved when Fiscal and Monetary policies converge

**Phillips curve** :

- inflation and rate of unemployment is inversely related or a trade off.
- later it was argued that this trade of high inflation and low unemployment was only short term and inflation would rise back once unemployment reaches its natural rate.
- In the long run monetary policy can influence inflation and suggested that if monetary policy tried to hold unemployment below its natural rate inflation would be rising to a higher level aka *NAIRU or Non Accelerating inflation rate of unemployment* or *it is the lowest unemployment rate that an economy can sustain without any upward pressur on inflation rate.*

Collection of Statistics Act 2008 - higher penalty for not sharing data, wilful manipulation is an offence, classify data as core statistics. #Act

Overheating of economy - demand overshoots supply, prices rise/inflation caused due to high growth rate

**Base Effect** refers to the impact of rise in price level if the base year prices were too low even lower inc in price would mean higher inflation rate.
