-   **Muhammad bin Tughlaq** led campaigns in the NW against Kalanur, Peshawar
-   aimed at securing the frontiers against future Mongol attacks.
-   1332 planned an expedition of Qarachil in Himachal under Khusrau Malik, disaster led to waste of resources and erosion of Tughlaqs authority
-   Khurasan expedition was also a disaster, recruited about 370,000 soldiers and paid them a year salary in advance but they were later disbanded.
-   Barani - GT and MBT were highly ambitious
-   Under MBT direct control extended to Warangal/ Telangana, Mabar/ Coromandal, Madurai/ TN, Dvar Samudra/ Karnataka
-   MBT strictly observed prayers and made others also follow
-   Deep understanding of Philosophy, mathematics, medicines, religion
-   Barani - was rationalist wanted logical proof, accuses of combining spiritual and political authority
-   Respected sufi saints, visited Tomb of Muinuddin Chisti
-   Associated w/ Jain Saints, visited temples, gave grants
 
## Rebellions under MBT

    -   Called foreigners Aziz/friends gave great patronage to them
    -   Approach towards Nobility not based on racial or religious considerations

    -   Daulatabad lost to Bahmani kingdom

## MBTs analysis as a ruler
-   Sultan was imaginative in his schemes but lacked practical wisdom
-   Lacked patience and wanted quick success, minor failure enraged him and abandoned schemes in haste
-   Not a good judge of men and circumstance
-   Not a successful leader

## Administrative Reforms

### Transfer of Capital 1328 
 
#### Reasons
-   Devagiri/Daulatabad centrally located, pleasant climate
-   Ibn Batuta - wanted to teach people of Delhi lesson for writing abusive letters Woolseley Haig has accepted this verison. Isami says that MBT wanted to break the power of the citizens
-   Gardner Brown and AL Srivastava says that reason was Mongol threat
-   Revolt in Mabar, Bubonic plague outbreak soldiers perished, rumour of MBT's death - Mabar, Dwar Samudra, Warangal became independent
-   Poets like Khusrau had created a beautiful picture of Devagiri
-   Sultan wanted to create another administrative, cultural centre for Muslim in the Deccan as per Habibullah and Mahdi Hussain
-   KA Nizami says that he wanted to have both Delhi, Daulatabad as capital
-   Barani exaggerates - led to ruination of Delhi
-   Ferishta - more familiar w/ it, already one of the great cities
-   Effects largely felt by upper sections,
 
#### Reasons for failure :
-   People had to cover a distance of 1500km. Barani says it left Delhi in complete ruins 
-   He should have shifted only his court
-   Isami says that Delhi was to be set on fire. 
   
### Khorasan Expedition
-   Raised a large army of 380,000 people, paid them in advance
-   Make Sindh-Punjab free from M(Chagtai) invasion
-   Barani - no care to enforce branding of horses or huliya, testing their swordmanship,
-   Kept idle for 1 yr then disbanded
 

### Qarachil/Kullu Kangra region of Himacha; expedition
-   Soon after Khorasan
-   Ferishta says this was to conquer China
-   Almost entire army perished
-   Barani wrongfully said - aimed to get horses from Turkistan
-   Not total failure, local ruler accepted overlordship


###   Deccan Policy
-  Wanted to annex Deccan, was very oppressive
-  Dwarsamundra of the Hoyasalas was devasted and caused discontent among Hindu population
 
 
## Economic Reforms


###  Use of token currency 1329-30
-   Copper and Brass coins (Tanka)
-   To raise a huge army, shortage of silver/gold coins (Jital)
-   Reform coinage
-   Dr Ishwari Prasad - unequalled in artistic perfection in design
-   China under Mongols/ Kublai Khan and Iran's Qai Katu had intro paper currency
-   Barani - recruit huge army to capture world, supplement treasury
-   Muhammad Habib - Broze coins had inscription in Persian, Arabic; people could not distinguish b/w these and forged ones
 

#### Mistakes
-   Did not employ measures to check faking, could not prevent forging
-   Barani mention that house of every Hindu became a mint.
-   People started hoarding silver and gold coins
-   Withdrawing caused exchange of fake coins too causing loss to treasury but most fake coins were not accepted
-   Large amounts accumulated, their value depreciated
-   Trade Commerce disrupted
 

#### Historiography
-   Irfan Habib has blamed citizens for not being able to distinguish b/w original and fake
-   Mahdi Hussain has called it to be successful and decision statesmanlike
-   Other historians have blamed the sultan
 

###  Bribing the Mongol
-   General Tarmashirin was bribed 500 dinars
-   Shows his weakness
-   Might not be true but it shows that Mongols were unchecked in region


# Agrarian Measures

---

## Agrarian Reforms
-   Mohammed bin Tughlaq introduced new abwabs/ cesses and revived the older ones like charai, gharai etc but did not tamper the rate fixed by Alauddin.
- @ assessment carried out not on actual yield but on officially decreed yields called **wafa-i-farmani** and **mirkh-i-farmani** were used.
-   extended sys of revenue collection to Gujarat, Malwa, Deccan, South India and Bengal.
-   Cattle were branded.
-   demand for revenue inc led to revolt around Delhi and doab.
- @   introduced the practice of giving agricultural loans named sondhar.
-   new minister called **Diwan-i amir-i Kohi** was estd for promote agriculture
-   Intro a register of the revenue and expenditure of each Iqta
-   Brief Experiment for reclamation of barren land through rotation of crop - estd of Diwan in Kohi
    -   60 sq miles area designated, 70 lakh tanka allocated
    -   Funds misappropriated, dept wound up after 3 yrs

### Heavy taxation of the doab
-   To raise a strong army, People were rich and could pay more taxes.
- $  Per Barani it was 20x the normal. Ferishta says 3-4 times. Gardner Brown says it was normal. AL Srivastava says about 5-10 percent. JL Mehta says 20%.
-   Rains had failed during the time and there were famine like conditions. Barani says many perished, Brown doesn't.
-   Farmers suffered, left their land, riots and rebellions broke out.
- !  Suppression was ruthless, later recalled and paid reparations. AL Srivastava says that it came too late.
- !  Charai and Gharai were already unpopular their collection became rigorous, usual revenue collected also decreased, made MBT unpopular; new cesses were also levied.
-   For assessing yield standard yield was taken not actual produce, Price were not actual but decided by officials - destruction of Peasantry
- $  Barani : enforcement was so rigorous that feeble and low among riyaya were wiped out, rich ones became rebellious.
	-   Bitterly criticises Sultan for this but never tells the actual amount by which it was inc, account of suffering of peasants in exaggerated
	-   Confuses principal points in story by over emphasising relationship b/w Doab, Spread of famine and widespread revolt.
-   Famine occurred during the same time, MBT advanced loans to dig wells, buy seed implements.
-   Diwan I Amir I Kohi set up to extend cultivation, bring barren land under cultivation not uncultivable land aka **Usar**, improve crops.
-   Total 70 lakh tankhas advanced as loans, Afif says 2cr.
- $  Barani - Entire scheme failed, person to implement were incompetent
- $ MBT died and FST wrote off the loan
-   Not total failure -> helped evolve agri policy that fully matured under Mughals
