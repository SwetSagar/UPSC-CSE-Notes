1. Right of movement and residence throughout the territory of India are freely available to the Indian citizens, but these rights are not absolute. Comment.

```ad-Answer


According to Article 19 (1) (d) and (e) of the Indian Constitution, every citizen of India has the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and to reside and settle in any part of it. Article 19(5) of the Constitution of India allows the government to impose reasonable restrictions on the right to movement and residence for reasons such as public order, security, and morality.

They are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the public interest or for the protection of any Scheduled Tribes’ interests3. For example, a person’s movement can be restricted by an externment order if he/she is found to be a threat to public order or security4. Similarly, a foreigner cannot claim these rights as they are only available to citizens of India.

Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978), the Supreme Court held that the right to travel abroad is a part of the right to personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Similarly, in the case of Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985), the Supreme Court recognized the right to livelihood as a part of the right to life under Article 21, and held that the right of a person to reside in the city cannot be taken away merely because he or she is poor.

1. Critically examine the procedures through which the Presidents of India and France are elected. (भारत और फांस के राटिट्पनत के ननवा्भचचत होने की प्हरिया का आलोचनात्मक परीक्ण कीजजए । ) - 2022

```ad-Answer

India: The President of India is elected by an Electoral College consisting of elected members of both Houses of Parliament, as well as members of Legislative Assemblies of all states and union territories. The President is elected by an indirect election, in which members of the Electoral College cast their votes. The candidate who secures more than 50% of the votes is declared the winner.

Criticism: The election of the President of India is criticized for being influenced by political considerations, and for not being entirely free from the influence of the ruling party.

France: The President of France is elected through a two-round direct election. All citizens over the age of 18 are eligible to vote. In the first round, all candidates are allowed to run. If no candidate secures an absolute majority of votes, the top two candidates compete in a second round of voting. The candidate who secures the highest number of votes in the second round is declared the winner.

Criticism: The French Presidential election has been criticized for leading to a two-party system, with small parties having little to no representation. The first-past-the-post system used in the second round has also been criticized for leading to tactical voting.

1. Analyze the distinguishing features of the notion of Right to Equality in the Constitutions of the USA and India. (सं युति राज्य अमेररका और भारत सं नवदानो में, समता के अ ं सधकार की धारणा की नवशिटि नविेषताओ का ं नवश्ेषण कीजजए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The USA derived this right from the Declaration of Rights and later added it to the Bill of Rights through the 14th Amendment in 1868. India incorporated this right in its Constitution from the beginning through Article 14 to 18.
The USA follows only the concept of ‘equal protection of law’, which means equal treatment under equal circumstances. India follows both ‘equality before law’ (British model) and ‘equal protection of law’ (American model), which means no one is above law and everyone is entitled to equal justice.

USA:

-   The right to equality is enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution.
-   It prohibits the state from denying any person equal protection of the laws.
-   The US Constitution emphasizes on equal treatment under the law and non-discrimination.
-   The concept of affirmative action, or policies that aim to address historical injustices, is not explicitly recognized in the US Constitution.

India:

-   The right to equality is enshrined in Articles 14-18 of the Indian Constitution.
-   The Indian Constitution emphasizes on equal treatment under the law, non-discrimination, and affirmative action.
-   The concept of affirmative action is explicitly recognized in the form of reservation policies that aim to address historical injustices and promote the interests of marginalized communities.
-   The Indian Constitution recognizes the principle of "equality before the law" and "equal protection of the laws", but also recognizes the concept of "reasonable classification" where the state can treat different classes of people differently.

Convergence: Both countries have a common law system based on precedents and statutes. Both countries have a Supreme Court as the highest court of appeal. Both countries have adopted digitization to improve access to justice and reduce backlog of cases. Both countries respect human rights and follow international conventions.
Divergence: India has a written constitution that grants judicial review power to the courts, while UK has an unwritten constitution that relies on parliamentary sovereignty. India has a federal system with separate state laws, while UK has a unitary system with uniform laws. India has affirmative action policies for disadvantaged groups, while UK does not.

1. “Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution is a limited power and it cannot be enlarged into absolute power.” In the light of this statement explain whether Parliament under Article 368 of the Constitution can destroy the Basic Structure of the Constitution by expanding its amending power? ("सं नवधान का सं िोधन करने की संसद की िक्ति एक पररसीगमत िक्ति है और इसे आत्यं नतक िक्ति के रूप में नवस्तृत नहीं हकया जा सकता है ।" इस कथिन के आलोक में व्याख्ा कीजजए की क्ा संसद सं नवधान के अनुछेद 368 के अंतग्भत अपनी सं िोधन की िक्ति का नविदीकरण करके सं नवधान के मूल ढांचे को नटि कर सकती है ?) - 2019

```ad-Answer

The basic structure doctrine, first propounded by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), holds that certain features of the Constitution are so fundamental that they cannot be amended by Parliament, even under Article 368. The basic structure includes features such as the supremacy of the Constitution, the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the protection of fundamental rights.

1.  Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): This case is significant for two reasons. Firstly, it upheld the fundamental right to free and fair elections as a basic feature of the Constitution. Secondly, it held that the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 is subject to judicial review.
    
2.  Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (1980): This case is significant because it reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine and held that Parliament cannot use its amending power to destroy the basic structure of the Constitution. It also held that the power to amend the Constitution is not an absolute power.
    
3.  Waman Rao v. Union of India (1981): This case is significant because it held that the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution includes the power to add or delete provisions, but not to abrogate the Constitution altogether.
    
4.  L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997): This case is significant because it held that the power of judicial review is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution and cannot be taken away by Parliament through a constitutional amendment.

1. (COMPARING Constitution) What can France learn from the Indian Constitution’s approach to secularism?(धम्भननरपेक्ता को भारत के सं नवधान के उपागम से फांस क्ा ससख सकता है?) - 2019

```ad-Answer

-   India’s secularism is based on equal respect and protection for all religions. The state does not interfere with religion, but also supports religious minorities and disadvantaged groups. The constitution grants judicial review power to the courts to uphold secular values.
-   France’s secularism is based on strict separation of religion and state. The state does not recognize or support any religion, but also forbids religious influence in public affairs. The constitution relies on parliamentary sovereignty to enforce secular laws.

France can learn from India’s secularism that:

-   Secularism does not mean hostility or indifference towards religion, but rather recognition and accommodation of religious diversity.
-   Secularism does not mean uniformity or assimilation of religious minorities, but rather respect and protection of their rights and identities.
-   Secularism does not mean suppression or exclusion of religious expression, but rather promotion and education of pluralistic values.

1. Examine the scope of Fundamental Rights in the light of the latest judgement of the Supreme Court on Right to Privacy. (ननजता के असधकार पर उच्चतम न्ायालय के नवीनतम ननण्भय के आलोक में, मौललक असधकारो के ं नवस्तार का परीक्ण कीजजए।) - 2017

```ad-Answer

The KS Puttaswamy case was a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court of India that recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India123. The court held that privacy is an intrinsic part of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) and also covers aspects of other fundamental rights such as Article 14 (right to equality), Article 19 (right to freedom) and Article 25 (right to freedom of religion).

The judgment on right to privacy has expanded the scope of fundamental rights in India by recognizing that privacy is not only a negative right against state interference but also a positive right that enables individuals to exercise their autonomy and dignity4. The court also laid down some principles for balancing privacy with other competing interests such as national security, public interest and social welfare4. The court also clarified that any law or policy that infringes on privacy must satisfy three tests: legality, necessity and proportionality

1. What do you understand by the concept "freedom of speech and expression"? Does it cover hate speech also? Why do the films in India stand on a slightly different plane from other forms of expression? Discuss. (आप ‘वाक् और अशभव्यक्ति स्ातंत्रय’ सं कपिना से क्ा समझते है? क्ा इसकी पररसध में घृणा वाक् भी आता है? भारत में हफल् अ ें शभव्यक्ति के अन् रूपो से तन ं नक शभन्न स्तर पर क्ो है? च ं चा्भ कीजजए।) - 2014

```ad-Answer

-   Freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution under Article 19(1)(a).
-   It includes the right to express one's opinions, ideas, and beliefs through any medium, including words, writing, print, art, and film.
-   However, this right is not absolute and can be subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2), such as in the interest of public order, decency, morality, security, or defamation.
-   Hate speech, which involves spreading messages that promote hatred or violence against individuals or groups based on their identity, is not protected under freedom of speech and expression.
-   The Supreme Court has held that hate speech can be restricted under the reasonable restrictions clause of Article 19(2), as it can lead to public disorder and threaten the rights and dignity of individuals and groups.
-   Films in India stand on a slightly different plane from other forms of expression because they are a combination of various art forms, including visual, auditory, and linguistic elements, and have a wider impact on society.
-   The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) regulates films in India and has the power to order cuts, modifications, or even ban a film if it violates the guidelines or laws in force, such as the Cinematograph Act or the Indian Penal Code.
-   However, the Supreme Court has held that the CBFC cannot act as a moral police or curtail the creative freedom of filmmakers, and its decisions must be guided by the principles of constitutional morality and the right to freedom of speech and expression.

1.  Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras (1950): In this case, the Supreme Court held that freedom of speech and expression includes the right to criticize and dissent, and that any attempt to stifle this right would be unconstitutional.
    
2.  K.A. Abbas v. Union of India (1971): The Court held that pre-censorship of films is unconstitutional as it is a restriction on the right to freedom of speech and expression.
    
3.  S. Rangarajan v. P. Jagjivan Ram (1989): The Court held that freedom of speech and expression cannot be curtailed unless it poses a clear and present danger to public order, and that a healthy democracy depends on the free flow of diverse views, opinions, and ideas.
    
4.  Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms (2002): The Court held that the right to freedom of speech and expression includes the right to receive and impart information and that the public has a right to know the criminal antecedents of candidates contesting elections.
    
5.  Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015): The Court struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which criminalized the sending of offensive messages through communication devices, on the grounds that it violated the right to freedom of speech and expression and was vague and overbroad.

- 2013

```ad-Answer

-   Section 66A of IT Act, 2000 criminalized sending "offensive" or "menacing" messages.
-   It was challenged in courts for violating the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.
-   In 2015, Supreme Court of India struck down Section 66A as unconstitutional in the landmark case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India.
-   The court held that the provision was a disproportionate restriction on the right to free speech and expression, as it criminalized a wide range of speech, including political speech, satire, and artistic expression.
-   The court also noted that the provision did not contain any safeguards against abuse, such as a requirement for prior judicial authorization or a clear definition of what constitutes an offense.
