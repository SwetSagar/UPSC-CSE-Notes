## Moon and the Universe

### Origin of Earth - Theories

- **Nebular hypothesis** : by Immanuel Kant revised by Laplace : planets were formed out of a cloud
- **Binary theory** : by **Chamberlain and Moulton** : **wandering star came near** formation of **cigar shaped extension** separated and condensed to form planets

#### Modern Theories

- Big Bang Theory was first proposed by Georges Lemaitre in 1931.
    - All matter in **one tiny ball**
    - exploded **13.7 bil** years ago -> first atoms.
    - Temp dropped - atomic matter
    - universe became transparent.
- **Hoyles's concept of steady state** : Universe roughly the same at any point in time

#### Formation of Stars and Planets

- Stars are formed by localised clumps in a Nebula
- Stages in the development of planets are :
    - core of a nebula becomes surrounded by a **rotating disc of gas and dust** due to gravitational force
    - cloud condenses -> round objects planetisimals
    - Which come together to form planets
- 1st 4 planets are Terrestrial and others called Jovian/Gas Giant

| Jovian                                   | Terrestrial                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Core is denser                           | Core not dense                           |
| Spin more and are flattened at the poles | Spin less hence poles are less flattened |
| more moons                               | less                                     |
| Have mostly H2 and He in atmosphere                    | Have CO2 and N2                                     |

##### Moon

- **Dumb bell theory by George Darwin** - Earth expelled a piece of its mass
- large body collided into Earth and formed the Moon was the **Big Splat Theory**
- **Moon Craters** created by 2 processes : **volcanism** and **cratering**.
	- largest - South-Pole Aitkin basin.
- lack water, atmosphere and techtonic plates reason for little erosion.

## Evolution of Earth

- Formation of lithosphere : heavier materials sank towards the centre, lighter ones came up cooled and formed crust

### Atmosphere

Stages in evolution of present atmosphere are :

- Initially made of Hydrogen and Helium/primordian atmosphere lost due to **solar winds**
- Hot interior released *gases and water vapour* called **Degassing**
- Leading to the formation of an early atmosphere containing *water vapour, N2, NH3, CO2, CH4, contained little free oxygen*.
- Life conc in oceans; photosynthesis saturated oceans w/ O2 which then flooded out
- Atmosphere is composed of Gases, Water vapour and Dust particles
	- Water Vapour
		- in warm tropics account for 4% of air by volume, less than 1 in poles and deserts
		- absorbs part of insolation, prevents E from becoming too hot or cold
	- Dust
		- conc in lower layers, air currents can take them higher
		- subtropical and temperate regions have higher conc due to dry winds blowing
		- act as Hygroscopic nuclei

#### Structure

- Troposphere
	- Avg height 13km, 8 near poles 18 near equator; temp dec as we go higher
	- contains dust, water vapour; all climatic/weather changes takes place here
	- Air temp at Tropopause is -80C
- Stratosphere
	- Extends upto 50km; Contains the Ozone layer
- Mesosphere
	- Extends upto 80km; Temp dec w/ inc in height reaching 100 C
- Ionosphere
	- from 80 - 400km; contains charged ions that reflect Radio waves
	- Temp inc w/ height

### Interior of the Earth

- **Exogenic** : from outside and Endogenic : from inside the Earth shaped the landscape of the Earth.

#### Sources of Information

  Direct Sources of information of the Earth are

 - Surface rocks
 - Rocks from Gold mines
 - From Deep Ocean drilling projects.
 - Volcanic Eruption

  Indirect sources of information about the interior of the Earth are

 - Depth of the Earth - leads to inc in Temp, Pressure
 - Meteorites - similar material
 - Seismic Waves
 - Gravity - diff gravity at places, most at Poles least over Equator
 - Magnetic Field - distribution of magnetic material

#### Earthquakes

- point where the energy of a quake is released is called a Focus or a Hypocenter on the surface it is called epicentre.
- Hypocenter/ Focus is point of release of Energy
- Point on the surface nearest to Focus is Epicentre
- All earthquakes take place in Lithosphere
- Intensity measured through **Mercalli scale**, Magnitude by **Richter**
- foci in areas of mid oceanic ridge are at **shallow depths** and in Alpine Himalayan belt are **deep seated**

##### Body Waves

- generated due to release of energy at focus.
- move in **all direction**
- further divided into- **P and S** waves.
- **Primary Pwaves**
	- faster and first to arrive at surface
	- Move through **Solid, Liquid and Gas** and are similar to sound waves
	- vibrate parallel to direction of the wave -> stretching and squeezing of material
	- shadow zone b/w 105deg - 145deg
- **Secondary S-waves**
	- through only Solids; more destructive
	- last to record on seismograph
	- travel perpendicular to waves and cause crest and troughs
	- shadow zone lies beyond 105deg

##### 2. Surface Waves

- formed when Body waves interact with surface rocks
- velocity and direction changes depending on the material density

The Various types of Earthquakes are :

 - **Tectonic** Earthquakes
 - **Volcanic** Earthquakes
 - **Collapse** Earthquakes : intense mining leads to roofs collapsing
 - Explosion
 - Reservoir Induced

### Structure of the Earth

**Crust**

- **Oceanic crust (5km)** thinner than **continental (30km) crust**
- oceanic crust rock is **Basalt**
- brittle, thicker under Mountains
- density from 2.7-3 gm/cm3

**Mantle**

- Extends from Mohos discontinuity to 2900 km has density of 3.4gm/cm3
- Upper portion is asthenosphere (astheno=weak) upto 400km contains most of the Magma
- Crust and upper mantle is called Lithosphere 100-200km

**Core**

- Extends from 2900km to 6300km
- Outer core is Liquid and inner core in solid state
- Density varies from 5 - 13 g/cm3
- Mostly consists of Nickle and Iron aka Nife layer

#### Volcanoes

  Shield Volcanoes

 - largest of all eg Hawaiian.
 - mostly made up of **Basalt** very fluid.
 - generally **low exlosive** until water gents into the vent.

  Composite Volcanoes

 - Eruptions are cooler and more viscous than basalt
 - Along with lava pyroclastic material and ashes are given out accumulates in the vent openings making the mouth appear as composite volcano.

  Caldera

 - most explosive, often collapse on themselves forming depressions called caldera
 - magma source is closer and bigger than others

  Flood Basalt Provinces

 - Very fluid lava travels long distances it is also thick more than **50m**
 - Eg the *deccan traps*.

  Mid Ocean ridge volcanoes

 - stretches more than 70,000km
 - central portion experiences frequent eruptions

##### Volcanic Landforms

- Depending on the cooling of the lava, igneous rocks are classified as **volcanic rocks** and **plutonic rocks**
- Rocks that cool in the crustal portion takes different forms called the **Intrusive forms**
- Dome shaped, granite bodies of cooled magma chamber formed in deeper depths of crust and appear on the surface after erosion are called **Batholiths**
- Large dome shaped intrusive bodies connected by pipe like conduits from below, localised sources of lava are called **Laccolith**. Eg Domal hills of granite rocks in Karnataka. ![[Earth-image1-00084383.jpg]]
- **Horizontal flow** of lava forms a **saucer shape concave to the sky body** Found at *base of synclines* and *top of anticlines* are called **Lopoliths**.
- **Phacoliths** are are conduits that source lapoliths from magma chambers
- Thin and Thick horizontal bodies of intrusive igneous rocks are called **sheets and sills**
- When lava solidifies perpendicular to the ground and cools at the same position to develop a wall like structure are called **Dykes**. Found in Maharashtra they were feeders for the eruptions that formed Deccan traps.

## Distribution of Oceans and Continents

### Continental Drift

  - Alfred Wegner in 1912 put forward continental drift theory.
 - single continental mass **Pangea** (split into 2 Laurasia and Gondwanaland) and mega ocean called **Panthalassa**

  Evidence in support of continental drift

 - Jig saw fit of continents
 - Rocks of same age across oceans suggesting no ocean existed b/w them
 - Tillite : sedimentary rock formed out of deposit glaciers found in India are also found in all six diff landmasses in the southern hemisphere
 - Placer deposits of gold in Ghana but source rock is missing
 - Distribution of Fossil
- According to Wegner Polar fleeing force ie rotation of the Earth and Tidal force i.e. attraction of moon and sun were responsible, found to be untrue.

#### Post Drift Studies

- Arthur Holmes put forward the Convectional Current Theory it said radioactive elements cause thermal difference leading to the formation of currents in the mantle.
	- Mobile rock beneath plates move in a circular manner, heated material comes up cools and goes back down again. Process repeats endlessly forming a current.
	- Radioactive decay and Residual heat are reasons source
- Rocks equidistant from the Mid Oceanic Ridge volcanoes had similar properties
- [[1.4 Oceans and Coastal Landforms#Sea Floor Spreading Theory]]

#### Plate Techtonics

- **Plate tectonics theory** was put forward by **Mckenzie and Parker in 1967**
- Tectonic plates are Massive irregularly shaped slab of solid rock composed of continental and oceanic lithosphere.
- 7 major and other minor plates
- What are the types of plate boundaries :
    - **Divergent Boundaries** eg Mid Atlantic Ridge, generates new crust
    - **Convergent Boundaries** : forms the subduction zone where one plate dived into another
    - **Transform Boundaries** : plates slide horizontally past each other, crust neither produced nor destroyed
- Indian Plate aka Indo Australian
	- Continent convergence along Himalayas forming a subduction zone
	- Tethys sea separated Eurasian plate(part of Laurasia) and Indian Plate (part of Gondwana)
	- During movt lave outpoured forming the Deccan traps

Diastrophic Plateaus :

| **Name of Plateaus**      | **Properties**                                                                   |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intermontane** Plateaus | highest and largest show variety of topographic features Eg Tibettan Plateau    |
| Mountain Border Plateaus  | Piedmont plateau b.w Atalntic coast and Appalachian mountain is an example       |
| Domed Plateaus            | Plateau of Ozark in USA is an example                                            |
| Volcanic Plateaus         |   ---                                                        |
| Erosional                 | found particularly in semi-arid regions and have cut away portions of high lands |
