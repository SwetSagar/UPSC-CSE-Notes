-   Oceanic mountain ranges and deep trenches are moslty located near Continent Margins.

## Sea Floor Spreading Theory
-   Evidences as proposed by **Hess** in *1961* are : ^4e69e9
    -   **Volanic eruptions** are common around the mid oceanic ridges.
    -   **Rocks equidistant from ridges show similarity** and the ones closer to the ridge are young.
    -   Oceanic crust is younger than continental crust
    -   Sediment in ocean floor are very thin and young
    -   Deep trenches have deep seated earthquakes while oceanic ridges are at shallow depths

## Water

- Water Cycle : 
	- Evaporation, Transpiration, Condensation, Precipitation
	- 59% of water falling returns to atmosphere by Evaporation

#### Major division of oceanic floor 
![[1629895564.jpg]]
-   Continental Shelf : 
	-   **shallowest** part, average gradient of **1deg** or less
	-   Average width is 80km, Depth varies from 30m to 600m
	-   longest shelf is Siberian shelf in Arctic Ocean stretches 1500km.
	-   sedimentary deposits brought by rivers make them sources of fossil fuels
- Continental Slope : 
	- gradient varies from **2-5deg**
	- Depth varies from 200mt to 3km
	- *Canyons and Trenches* are observed in this region.
- Deep Sea plains
	- flat and smooth, Depth Varies from **3km to 6km**
	-  covered with fine grained sediments like silt and clay.
- Oceanic Deeps or Trenches
	- steep sides, 3-5 km deeper than surrounding
	- occur at bases of slopes along, volcanoes and earthquakes are common

### Minor Relief Features
- Mid oceanic ridge : 
	- 2 chains of mountains separated by large depression
	- islands like Iceland are ex of mountains rising to surface part of mid-Atlantic ridge
-   Seamounts 
	-   Pointed summits rising from seafloor that does not reach the surface 
	-   Volcanic in origin. 
	-   Flat topped seamount are called Guyots
	- ![[Pasted image 20220330110956.png]]
-   Submarine Canyons 
	-   deep valleys similar to canyons on land ex Hudson Canyon
	- ![[Pasted image 20220330111126.png | 500]]
-   Atoll 
	-   ring-shaped reef, island, or chain of islands formed of coral. 
	-   Mostly found in **tropical regions** around a central depression

#### Temperature of Ocean Water
Factors affecting temp distribution of ocean water?
-   Latitude 
-   Contact of oceans with land : ex Ocena in Northern Hemisphere receive more heat due to more contact w/ land
-   Prevailing winds : ex blowing from land causes upwelling by driving warm water away from coast, vice versa causes warm waters near coasts
-   Oceanic currents

Horizontal and Vertical Distribution
- **Vertical Dist**
	-  First layer : 500 mt thick, 20-25°C temp, always present in tropical region but only in summer in mid latitudes
	-  Second layer : aka thermocline where temp dec rapidly, 500-1000mt thick
	-  Third layer : extends upto ocean floor, temp change very slight
-   **Horizontal Dist** 
	-   temp gradually dec from equator to poles, highest temp not at equator but slightly north to it
	-   Avg temp fo Northern Hemisphere more due to more land area

#### Salinity
- 24.7 is upper limit to demarcate brackish water

Factors affecting salinity of oceans?
-   Evaporation and Precipitaion
-   Fresh water flow from rivers, glaciers
-   Wind
-   Ocean Currents

Horizontal Dist
- land locked areas show higher salinity, even more in hotter regions
- ==Salinity in western parts of NH is less due to influx of melted water from Arctic region==
- Generally dec northwards but <u>North Sea has high due to saline water influx from North Atlantic Drift</u>
	- Baltic sea has <u>low</u> due to rivers draining in it
	- Mediterranean sea has high salinity due to high evaporation 
- IN ocean avg salinity is 35ppm

Veritcal Distribution
-   Inc at surface due to evaporation
-   Salinity at depth is fixed
-   Distinct zone in ocean where salinity increases sharply is called Halocline.

## Movement of Ocean Water
- Horizontal is Oceanic currents and waves
### Waves
-  are energy not water
-  features are crest, trough, height, amplitude (half of height), period (time b/w 2 waves), speed and frequency

### Tides
-   Periodical rise and fall of sea level, attraction of sun-moon (more prominent) and centrifugal force is the cause.
-   Movt of water by meteorological effects viz winds, pressure changes are called **surges**
-   Tides based on frequency
	-   Semi Diurnal Tides are most common tides 
		-   Has 2 high tides and 2 low tides 
		-   successive tides are of same height.
	-   Diurnal 
		-   have 1 high and 1 low tide during each day
		-   successive tides of same height
	-   Mixed Tides 
		-   have variations in height mostly along west coast of North America
-   Tides based on position of Sun, Moon, Earth
	-   Spring tides 
		-   all three in straight line, occur twice a month
		-   height is higher
	-   Neap tides 
		-   Sun, Moon at right angles, counteracting each other
		-   Occur after 7 days of Spring tide
-  Ebb : time between high tide and low tide, when the water level is falling
-   Flow : time between the low tide and high tide, when the tide is rising aka flood
   
### Ocean Currents
- have regular vol, definite path and direction
- Strongest near surface, slower at deeper depths

#### Primary forces that influence currents
-   Heating by Solar Energy
-   Wind
-   Gravity
-   Coriolis Force
<p></p>
-   Large accumulations of water and flow around them is called Gyres which produce large circular currents
- Difference in water density affects vertical mobility of currents #PrelimsPYQ 

####  Types based on Dept and Temp
- Surface Currents : 
	- 10% of all water in ocena
	- upper 400m of the ocean
- Deep water currents : other 90% 

#####   Cold currents 
-   usually found in the west coast of continents in low and middle latitude in both hemispheres -> causing aridity in the region
-   in East coast at higher latitudes in **Northern Hemisphere**.

##### Warm Currents
-   East Coast in low and middle latitudes -> results in warm and rainy climates
-   West Coast at high latitudes in the Northern H -> marine type climate w/ cool summers and mild winters

##### El Nino #important
-  El Nino appears once in every **3-7** years.
-  an extension of  warm **Peruvian** current. 
- It causes :
	-   Distortion of equatorial atmospheric circulation.
	-   irregularities in the evaporation of the sea.
	-   ==Decrease in phytoplanktons== leading to dec in fishes.

- Oceanic circulation pattern corresponds to E's atmospheric circulation pattern
- Air circulation in middle lats is anticyclonic more pronounced in Southern H; cyclonic at higher depths
- Mixing of Cold and Warm currents leads to phytoplankton growth, are one of the best fishing grounds

##### Indian Ocean dipole IOD
- difference b/w temp of Bay of Bengal (Eastern pole) and Arabian Sea (western pole) → pressure diff this difference in temperatures is called Indian Ocean Dipole. 
- Positive IOD is cooler temp in BoB and warm in Arabian sea; Opposite is vice versa. It brings more rainfall in the western Indian ocean region and cooling of waters in the eastern Indian ocean causing drought like conditions.
- Positive IOD causes above avg rainfall, results in more cyclone in Arabian Sea. It is favorable towards bringing Indian ocean. 
- Negative IOD cause tropical cyclones in BoB
- IOD involves a periodic oscillation of sea surface temperatures SST between 'positive',  'neutral' and 'negative'.
