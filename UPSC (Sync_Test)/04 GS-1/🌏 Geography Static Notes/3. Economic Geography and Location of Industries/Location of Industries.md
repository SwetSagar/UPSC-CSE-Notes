- River near it helps in transportation, clean water for production
- Commercial lumbering - in **Ontario, Quebec in Canada**
    - Softwood easy chop, forests concentrated
    - Snow helps dec friction and faster movt, road connectivity is deep
    - Labour inc during winter due to dec in agri activities, mechanisation is high
    - Ready-made market in USA
    - Cheap hydroelectricity due to more rivers, better connected/all-weather power grids
- Challenge in Tropical areas
    - Scattered trees, dense vegetation makes transport difficult, high extraction cost, hardwood
    - Sparse settlement away from market
    - Lax regulation, weak organisation
- In Britain areas near Thames, Manchester
- Scandinavian countries like Finland, Denmark
- Malaysia, Phillipines - Australia, Japan but hardwood
- Myanmar, Thailand
- South Gujarat, Odisha, MP near raw material Softwood and Bamboo
- Kolkata, Lucknow near market, cheap labour, electricity, coal, water etc available

## Commercial Fishing Industry

- Located in middle - higher latitudes in Northern hemisphere due to plankton availability, cool water, better sunlight
- Where cold and hot currents meet ex Gulf stream and Labrador
- Market is readily available especial in Asian countries Japan, China etc, used for fish oils, waxes, medicinal purposes, religious/cultural reasons
- Indented/zig zag coastline has many fishing sites
- Cool climate more people switch to fishing, helps preservation
- Dogger bank, great fisher bank in North Europe, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland in Canada etc
- Asian coastline not indented very smooth, narrow continental shelves, low capital investment in technology/equipment, variety of fished make large scale fishing difficult, high oil content
- Southern hem demand for dairy more
- Norway and Japan fishing nation
- West Coastline more indented, wide, continent shelf, more fishes, prawn and mackerel found in abundance

## Cotton Textile Industry

- Cotton - Yarn has no weight loss thus proximity to raw material not imp, water required for dyeing, bleaching

    - 90% cultivation in Kolkata, energy from Raniganj and Jharia coal mines**, washing, bleaching and retting** from Hugly river, cheap labour, good banking facilites
    - New machinery needed, wage rate hike, competition from synthetic packaging material, lack of marketing strategy
- Linen made from Flax plant

### Silk Industry of China, India and Karnataka

- Was introduced in France but vanished after disease killed silkworms. But Lyon now is an imp fashion centre due to skilled labour
- Silk **easily transportable, non-perishable, non-bulky**
- Demand in industrialised countries
- Was introduced in Virginia and Georgia but failed
- Japan failed due to workers shifting to industrial sector for higher wages, better returns in other industries, women shifted to Jeans instead of Kimono
- China produces 80% India 18%
- China
    - Lower Yangtze - mulberry silk
    - Hybrid worms allows year wide rearing

## Plantation

- American P controlled by rich families built on slave labour, Asian P setup, financed, controlled by companies based on Europe, indentured labour from India, China
- Types are
    - Tree Crops : lifecycle 2 yrs, years to mature, remains productive for long period, ex oil palm, coconut, cocoa
    - Field crops : less maintenance than tree crops, sugarcane, banana
    - Annuals : single plantation, harvest every year, Cotton, jute, tobacco, groundnut better suited for small holders
- Rubber, Cocoa have long gestation, large investment needed, need to absorb price shocks - not appropriate for small scale farmers
- Cocoa Plantation
    - Central and South America originally, Spanish brought to EUR then introduced to West Africa like Ghana
    - Ghana aka Cocoa Triangle - warm wet climate, cheap labour to manually cut with machete, export to US, EUR
- Remove pulp from fruit, cover in banana seed to ferment then sun dry it, roasted then either made powder or butter
- India


### Rubber Plantation in Malaysia, Kerala and South America

- From latex of rubber trees, diluted with water add acid to coagulate rubber and form slabs, remove slabs to squeeze liquid, dried to become thin sheets

    - Moderating influence of seas, calcareous fertile soil, American capital and market, EUR market, USSR support later and change of gov policy towards Communist/ Socialist countries
- Sugar Beet extracted in Germany, France, Belgium

### Tea

- Need for skilled man power, grown in hill slopes so mechanisation not possible, done in high population density
- RM - leaves, involves weight loss processing done in estate itself, very long winter and frost harms, stagnant water harmful
- Black tea - sun dried - steam rolled - fermented - roasted. India and EUR
- Green Tea - heated with steam not fermented used in JP, East Asia
- London was centre of tea trade due to colonisation
- Darjeeling Tea
    - Growth due to loss of Tea monopoly over China trade in 1830, Indigo cropping in Bihar did not give good returns, Suez canal opening
    - Morning fog, low temp gives high grade leaf, water from rivers like Tista, Mahananda, Himalayan snow melt, SW monsoon
    - Good quantity of phosphorous+ potash gives special flavour, in hilly areas, large estates provide for labour, market provide for local+ foreign demand, proximity to Kolkata port
- Tea grown in YangtzeKiang and Sikiang valleys in China
- Other areas are SL, JP - red volcanic soil , Indonesia - ocean breeze and cheap supply of female labour

### Coffee Plantation

- Boston Tea Party, dec in tea supply, switch to coffee
- Direct sunlight is harmful, sea mist in Yemen/Ethiopia is favourable, waterlogging is harmful, orographic rainfall in hilly slope is best condition
- Mechanisation not possible in hilly slopes, secondary processing done in different/importing countries
