1. Describe the characteristics and types of primary rocks. (प्ाथिगमक चट्ानो की ं नविेषताओ एवं ं प्कारो का व ं ण्भन
कीजजए।) 2022

```ad-Answer

Primary rocks are rocks that are formed from the solidification of magma or lava. They are also referred to as igneous rocks. The following are the characteristics and types of primary rocks:

Characteristics of primary rocks:

1.  Cooling history: The cooling history of the magma or lava plays a significant role in determining the type of primary rock that will form. The rate of cooling determines the size and arrangement of mineral grains within the rock.
    
2.  Mineral composition: The mineral composition of primary rocks depends on the chemical composition of the magma or lava. Magma rich in silica is likely to form rocks with abundant feldspar and quartz, while magma with lower silica content is likely to form rocks with minerals such as olivine and pyroxene.
    
3.  Texture: The texture of primary rocks refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral grains within the rock. There are two main types of textures in primary rocks: phaneritic and aphanitic. Phaneritic textures have large mineral grains that can be seen with the naked eye, while aphanitic textures have small mineral grains that cannot be seen with the naked eye.
    

Types of primary rocks:

1.  Granite: Granite is a common type of primary rock that is formed from the solidification of silica-rich magma. It is composed of minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica and has a phaneritic texture.
    
2.  Basalt: Basalt is a type of primary rock that is formed from the solidification of mafic magma. It is composed of minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase and has an aphanitic texture.
    
3.  Diorite: Diorite is a type of primary rock that is intermediate in composition between basalt and granite. It is composed of minerals such as plagioclase, hornblende, and biotite and has a phaneritic texture.
    
4.  Gabbro: Gabbro is a type of primary rock that is similar in composition to basalt. It is composed of minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase and has a phaneritic texture.
    
5.  Peridotite: Peridotite is a type of primary rock that is composed primarily of the mineral olivine. It is formed from the solidification of ultramafic magma and has a phaneritic texture.
    
6.  Pumice: Pumice is a type of primary rock that is formed from the solidification of explosive volcanic eruptions. It is composed of frothy, vesicular glass and has a very light, porous texture.

1. Troposphere is a very significant atmospheric layer that determines weather processes. How? ( क्ोभमं डल वायुमं डल का एक महत्त्वपूण्भ परत है जो मौसम प्हरियाओ को न ं नधा्भररत करता है। कै से ?) 2022

```ad-Answer

Troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth’s atmosphere and is the most important layer for weather processes. It is the layer closest to the Earth’s surface and is where most weather takes place. The troposphere is filled with a mixture of gases and dust particles and is the warmest layer of the atmosphere.

The troposphere is important for weather processes because it contains the majority of the Earth’s atmospheric gases and dust particles, which interact with the sun’s energy to create clouds and precipitation. The temperature of the troposphere decreases with altitude, and this temperature gradient helps drive convectional currents which are essential for the formation of clouds and storms.

The troposphere also contains the majority of the Earth’s water vapor and this is important for weather processes as it is the primary source of energy for the formation of clouds and precipitation. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas and helps to trap heat energy in the atmosphere, which helps to maintain a warmer climate.

The troposphere also contains the majority of the Earth’s ozone and this is important for weather processes as it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas and helps to trap heat energy in the atmosphere, which helps to maintain a warmer climate.

Finally, the troposphere is important for weather processes as it is the layer of the atmosphere where most of the Earth’s air is found. This air is constantly moving and is important for the formation of winds and storms. The air in the troposphere is also constantly mixing, which helps to distribute heat and moisture around the world and is essential for the formation of clouds and storms.

1. What are the forces that influence ocean currents? Describe their role in fishing industry of the world. (समुद्री धाराओ को ं प्भानवत करने वाली िक्तियाँ कौन सी है ? नवश् के मत्स्य उद्योग में इनके योगदान का वण्भन करें ) 2022

```ad-Answer

Oceanic currents are large, continuous and directed movements of seawater generated by a variety of forces, including the wind, the Coriolis effect, gravity, and the tides. They play a critical role in the global climate by redistributing heat around the planet, affecting the climate of the regions near them.

-Winds: Blow surface waters in a particular direction and cause surface currents.
-Earth's Rotation: Coriolis force causes currents to move in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
-Gravity: Causes water to move from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.
-Tides: Cause water to move up and down the coastline in a predictable pattern.

Role of Ocean Currents in Fishing Industry:
-Provides nutrients to coastal waters, which can support a variety of marine life. 
-Enables fish to migrate to areas with more favorable conditions.
-Can help fishermen find areas with more abundant fish populations.
-Can affect the availability of certain species of fish. 
-Can help fishermen predict the movement of fish populations.

1. Why is India considered as a subcontinent? Elaborate your answer. (भारत को एक उपमहाद्ीप क्ो माना जाता ं है ? नवस्तारपूव्भक उत्र दीजजए।) 2021

```ad-Answer


India is considered a subcontinent because it is a large landmass that is geographically distinct from the rest of Asia. It is bordered by the Himalayas to the north, the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to the west and south, and the Indian Ocean to the south and east. It is home to a variety of climates and landscapes, ranging from the tropical rainforests of the south to the Himalayan peaks in the north. India is home to a diverse population, with a mix of religions, languages, and cultures. India is also a major economic power, with a large and growing middle class. All of these factors combined make India a distinct subcontinent.

1. Briefly mention the alignment of major mountain ranges of the world and explain their impact on local weather conditions, with examples. (नवश् की प्मुख पव्भत शं खलाओ के सं रेखण का सं ं शक्प्त उल्ेख कीजजए तथिा उनके स्ानीय मौसम पर पडें प्भावो का सोदाहरण व ं ण्भन कीजजए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The major mountain ranges of the world are generally aligned in a north-south direction and have a significant impact on local weather conditions. For example, the Rocky Mountains in North America form a barrier to the eastward flow of moist air from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in a drier climate east of the range. Similarly, the Andes in South America form a barrier to the westward flow of moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, leading to a much drier climate in the western parts of the continent.

The Himalayan Mountains in Asia act as a barrier to the cold, dry air from the north, resulting in a warmer and more humid climate in the south. The Alps in Europe form a barrier to the moist air from the Mediterranean Sea, leading to a cooler, wetter climate in the northern parts of the continent.

The impact of these mountain ranges on local weather conditions is further enhanced by the local topography. For example, the windward sides of mountains tend to receive more rainfall due to the orographic effect, while the leeward sides tend to be much drier. This can be seen in the rain shadow effect of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, which creates a dry climate in the Great Basin on the east side of the range.

1. The process of desertification does not have climatic boundaries. Justify with examples.
(मरुिलीकरण के प्रिम की जलवायनवक सीमाएँ नही होती है। उदाहरणो ं सह ं हत औचचत्य ससधि कीजजए।) 2020

```ad-Answer

Desertification is a process of land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas due to various factors, including climatic variations and human activities as per United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). It is a global problem, with a growing impact on the environment, ecosystems, and biodiversity. Despite its name, desertification is not limited to deserts, but can occur in any dry region, including grasslands, shrublands, and savannas. 

Climate change is a major factor in desertification. As temperatures rise, water resources become scarcer and arid and semi-arid areas become drier. This leads to soil erosion, vegetation loss, and land degradation, which can eventually result in desertification. 

In addition to climate change, human activities can also contribute to desertification. Overgrazing, deforestation, and unsustainable agricultural practices can all lead to land degradation and desertification. Overgrazing can lead to soil erosion and vegetation loss, while deforestation can cause soil erosion, loss of nutrients, and reduced water retention. Unsustainable agricultural practices, such as monocropping, can also lead to soil erosion, nutrient loss, and water depletion. 

Desertification can also be caused by natural disasters, such as droughts and floods. Droughts can cause soil erosion, vegetation loss, and land degradation, while floods can lead to soil erosion, nutrient loss, and waterlogging. 

The effects of desertification are felt around the world. In Africa, desertification has caused widespread poverty, food insecurity, and displacement of people. In the Sahel region of Africa, desertification has resulted in loss of soil fertility, decreased crop yields, and increased poverty. In the United States, desertification has caused soil erosion, vegetation loss, and decreased water availability in some areas.

1. Define mantle plume and explain its role in plate tectonics. ('मेंिल प्लूम' को पररभानषत कीजजए और प्लेि नववत्भननकी में इसकी भूगमका को स्पटि कीजजए।) 2018

```ad-Answer

A mantle plume is a column of hot rock rising up from the mantle, through the Earth’s crust, and sometimes even reaching the surface. Mantle plumes are thought to be driven by convection currents in the Earth’s mantle, which are caused by the release of heat from the Earth’s core.

Mantle plumes are important in plate tectonics because they are thought to be responsible for the formation of hotspots, which are areas on Earth’s surface that are unusually volcanically active. Hotspots are thought to form when a mantle plume rises up and causes melting of the Earth’s crust, forming a volcano. This melting can also cause the plate above the plume to move, resulting in the formation of a new plate boundary. Hotspots are also thought to be responsible for the formation of chains of islands, such as the Hawaiian islands.

1. How does the Juno Mission of NASA help to understand the origin and evolution of the Earth? ('नासा' का जूनो गमिन पृथ्ी की उत्चत् एवं नवकास को समझने में हकस प्कार सहायता करता है ?) 2017

```ad-Answer

The Juno mission of NASA is helping to understand the origin and evolution of the Earth by providing insight into the formation and evolution of the solar system. Launched in 2011, the Juno spacecraft is the first mission to explore the interior of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system. As such, it is providing scientists with unprecedented insight into the formation and evolution of the solar system and its planets, including Earth.

Jupiter is believed to have formed from the same disk of gas and dust that formed the Sun and other planets. By studying the composition, structure, and dynamics of Jupiter, scientists can gain insight into the formation and evolution of the solar system. For example, the Juno mission has revealed that Jupiter’s composition is similar to that of the Sun, indicating that the two were formed from the same material. Additionally, by studying the distribution of elements within Jupiter, scientists can gain insight into the conditions that existed during the formation of the solar system.

In addition to providing insight into the formation of the solar system, the Juno mission is also helping to understand the evolution of the Earth. By studying Jupiter, scientists can gain insight into the conditions that existed during the formation of the Earth and other planets. For example, the Juno mission has revealed that Jupiter has a surprisingly strong magnetic field, which may have helped to protect the Earth from harmful radiation during its formation. Additionally, by studying the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere, scientists can gain insight into the composition of the early Earth’s atmosphere.

Finally, the Juno mission is helping to understand the evolution of the Earth by providing insight into the dynamics of the solar system. By studying the gravitational interactions between Jupiter and the other planets, scientists can gain insight into the evolution of the orbits of the planets, including the Earth. Additionally, by studying the rotation of Jupiter, scientists can gain insight into the dynamics of the solar system, which can help to explain the evolution of the Earth’s climate and the formation of its oceans.

1. "The Himalayas are highly prone to landslides." Discuss the causes and suggest suitable
measures of mitigation. ("हहमालय भूस्खलनो के ं प्नत अत्यसधक प्वण हैं।" कारणो की ं नववेचना कीजजए तथिा अपिीकरण के उपयुति उपाय सुझाइए।) 2016

```ad-Answer

The Himalayas are one of the most landslide-prone regions in the world. This is due to a combination of factors, including the steep terrain, high rainfall, high seismic activity, and the presence of permafrost in the higher elevations. As a result, landslides can cause significant damage to infrastructure, disrupt transportation, and cause loss of life and property.

The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has identified a number of strategies to mitigate the risk of landslides in the Himalayas. These include: strengthening early warning systems, improving land use practices, and increasing public awareness. Additionally, UNDRR recommends the use of structural measures such as terracing, gabion walls, and retaining walls to reduce slope instability.

Other mitigation strategies include: maintaining vegetation cover to reduce soil erosion and promote stability; constructing drainage systems to reduce water pressure on slopes; and ensuring that buildings and other infrastructure are constructed in accordance with local building codes and regulations. Additionally, it is important to ensure that any construction or development activities in landslide-prone areas are undertaken in a sustainable manner. Finally, it is essential to strengthen the capacity of local communities to respond to and manage landslide risks.

1. Explain the formation of thousands of islands in Indonesian and Philippines archipelagos.
(इंडोनेशियाई और हफललपीनी द्ीपसमूहो में हजारो ं द् ं ीपो के ं नवरचन की व्याख्ा कीजजए।) 2014

```ad-Answer

The Indonesian and Philippines archipelagos are two of the most geographically diverse island chains in the world. Both are located in the western Pacific Ocean and are characterized by thousands of islands, many of which are volcanic in origin. This vast network of islands is the result of a combination of geologic and tectonic processes, including plate tectonics, seafloor spreading, volcanic activity, and erosion.

At the heart of the formation of these archipelagos is plate tectonics. The archipelagos are located in a region of the Pacific Ocean known as the "Ring of Fire," where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Philippine and Eurasian plates. This process causes earthquakes and volcanoes, which contribute to the formation of the islands.

Seafloor spreading is another factor in the formation of these archipelagos. As the Pacific Plate moves away from the Eurasian and Philippine plates, molten rock from the mantle rises up and cools, forming new seafloor. This process is known as seafloor spreading, and it is responsible for the creation of new islands in the archipelagos.

Volcanic activity is also an important factor in the formation of the islands in the Indonesian and Philippines archipelagos. The Ring of Fire is home to many active volcanoes, which can erupt and spew lava, ash, and other materials into the air. This material can then settle and form new islands.

Finally, erosion plays a role in the formation of the islands in the archipelagos. Over time, the islands are eroded by wind, waves, and rain, which can cause them to break apart and form new islands. Additionally, the islands can be reshaped by the action of the ocean currents, which can cause them to move and form new shapes.

Fold mountain systems are located along the margins of continents because they form as a result of tectonic plate movement. When two plates collide, the edges of each plate buckle and fold, creating a mountain range. This process is known as orogeny.

The global distribution of fold mountains is also associated with earthquakes and volcanoes. As tectonic plates move and collide, they cause the Earth's crust to become unstable and create seismic activity. This seismic activity can cause earthquakes and volcanoes to form. As the plates continue to move, the mountains can become taller and more rugged. This is why fold mountains are often associated with seismic activity and volcanic eruptions.

1. What do you understand by the theory of continental drift? Discuss the prominent evidences in its support. (‘महाद्ीपीय नवस्ापन’ के ससधिान् से आप क्ा समझते हैं? इसके पक् में प्मुख साक्ो की ं नववेचना कीजजए।) 2013

```ad-Answer

The theory of continental drift is the idea that the continents have moved across the Earth’s surface over millions of years. This theory was proposed by the German geologist Alfred Wegener in 1912 and was later supported by the discovery of plate tectonics.

The theory of continental drift is based on several lines of evidence. The first is the observation that the continents appear to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. If the continents were pushed together, the edges of the continents would line up perfectly. This is especially evident in South America and Africa, which have a very similar coastline.

The second line of evidence is the distribution of fossils. Fossils of the same species have been found on different continents, suggesting that the continents were once connected. For example, fossils of the Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile, have been found in both South America and Africa.

The third line of evidence is the distribution of rock types. Rocks that are found in the same locations on different continents often have similar characteristics. This suggests that the continents were once connected and the rocks were formed in the same location.

Finally, the fourth line of evidence is the distribution of mountain ranges. The Appalachian Mountains in North America, the Caledonides in Europe, and the Ural Mountains in Asia all have similar characteristics, suggesting that they were once connected.

The theory of continental drift is an important part of the modern understanding of plate tectonics. Plate tectonics is the theory that the Earth’s crust is made up of several large plates that move across the surface of the Earth. The movement of these plates causes the continents to drift apart.

1. There is no formation of deltas by rivers of the Western Ghat. Why? (पजचिमी घाि की नहदयाँ डेल्ा नही बनाती। ं क्ो?) ं 2013

```ad-Answer

The Western Ghats are a range of steep, rugged mountains that are not conducive to the formation of deltas. The rivers of the Western Ghats are typically short and steep, and they lack the flat, low-lying areas needed for the development of a delta. Furthermore, the rivers of the Western Ghats are prone to rapid flooding, which can quickly erode any sediment that may have been deposited in a delta.

1. Major hot deserts in northern hemisphere are located between 20-30 degree north and on the western side of the continents. Why? (उत्री-गोलाध्भ में मुख् गम्भ मरुभूगम 20-30 हडग्री उत्री आक्ांि पर और महाद्ीपो के ं पजचिम की ओर स्स्त है। क्ो?) ं 2013

```ad-Answer

Hot deserts in the northern hemisphere are located between 20-30 degree north and on the western side of the continents because of the presence of the subtropical high pressure belt. This pressure belt is created by the descending air from the Hadley Cell, which is a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern in the tropics. The descending air creates an area of high pressure, which causes warm, dry air to flow towards the western side of the continents. This warm, dry air creates a desert climate with very little rainfall. The western side of the continents also tends to be more sheltered from the prevailing winds, which can bring moisture from the oceans, further contributing to the dry climate of the hot deserts.
