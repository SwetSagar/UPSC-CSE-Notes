## Surat split
- congress split at Surat in **December 1907**. 
- Moderates wanted to work within the constitutional framework under the British Empire
- Extremists believed that the war of independence had begun
- Pherozeshah Mehta, Dinshaw Wacha, Gokhale did not appreciate radical tendencies
-   Lal, Tilak wanted reconciliation
-   Ajit Singh not wanted compromise
-   Issue was how to incorporate radicalism into future politics of Congress
-   1906 Calcutta session - victory of Extremists w/ support from C Moderates 4 res passed partition condemned
    -   Boycott, swadeshi, national education, swaraj
    -   Extremist party born w/ Tilak as leader
-   1907 - schedules at Poona extremist stronghold, moderates shifted to Surat, Lala refused president, Rash Behari Ghosh won
    -   Mehta wanted purging extremists
    -   1908 Bengal model of politics rejected, allegiance to Raj reiterated

## Failures and Limitations of Moderates
-   Lacked faith in common people and failed to acquire a root among them
-   Failed to organise mass movements
-   idea of pleas did not bring enough administrative and other reforms and were treated with contempt by the British.
-   beliefs and political ideas had become obsolete
-   seen as the weaker link among the nationalists.
-   John Morley in 1907 put forward the **policy of repression-conciliation-suppression** aka the policy of **carrot and stick.**
-   Moderates led by Pherozshah Mehta thought it to be dangerous to be with the extremists.
-   Both the parties were unable to see that the colonial state was negotiating because of the fear of extremists and that the Moderates were the outer defence for the extremists
-   Both failed to gauge the importance of a nationwide mass movement
  
## Analysis of Moderates
