## Reasons for Launching the Struggle

- Economic social life deteriorated

  > Max Harcourt - main problem was scarcity crisis shortfall of rice

- Rice crisis : seasonal condition, stoppage supply of Burmese rice, stringent procurement policy of B
- Excess profit tax, forcible collection of war funds,
- coercive sale of war bonds, stories of brutality by USA, AUS soldiers, refugees etc
- collapse of B colonial rule in SE asia

## Prelude

- MG in militant mood in 1942 as Jap invasion became threat, refused to believe Japs to be IN liberators, IN in the hands of Indians best guarantee against fascist aggression
- Rumors that by middle of 1942 B rule would collapse

- Gandhiji undertook a fast of 21 days when asked to condemn the ongoing violence in Feb 1943.
- raised the morale and heightened the anti-British feelings.
- The erosion of loyalty to the British govt was the most striking aspect of QIM

  > Linlithgow : most violent since 1857, spontaneous bcoz upper Echelon was behind bars - no preconceived plant to produce such instantaneous and uniform result

- Not just an impulsive resp - masses already conducted radical action under AITUC, CSP, AIKS, INC who had already prepared ground
- AICC issued instructions to peasants, MG ambivalent on non-violence said people can decide what they have to do in this struggle
