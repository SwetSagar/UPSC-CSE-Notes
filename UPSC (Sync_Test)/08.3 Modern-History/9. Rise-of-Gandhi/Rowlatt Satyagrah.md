-   repression was varied

## Analysis : Success or Failure?
-   Failed to repeal act Himalayan blunder offering Satyagrah
-   Marked beg from politics of restricted classed to pol of mass
-   More effective in cities
-   Absence of popular consciousness and central org
-   Set up Satyagraha Sabha in Bombay
-   Failure made him realise need for impersonal political org like INC
