- Deccan Agrarian Outbreak in Poona and Ahmednagar (1875) :
- Deccan Riots occured after the Gov decided to raise land revenue by 50% in 1867 after the end of American Civil War.
- **Social boycott** against moneylenders ended with the passing of the **Deccan Agriculturist Relief Act** in 1879.
- Poona, Ahmednagar, Sholapur and Satara.

**Background**

- Ryotwari system was prevalent here, Peasants found it impossible to give revenue without the lending money from Moneylenders.
- American Civil War had pushed up demand and prices when it ended it brought recession. Govt inc. revenue demand by 50%, situation became worst by succession of bad harvest.
- started in Kardab village in Sirur taluq against the pulling down of the house of a peasant by the local moneylender.
- resorted to social boycott.
- Spread to Poona, Ahmednagar, Sholapur and Satara.
- soon turned into agrarian ryots, attacked the houses of moneylenders, burnt debt bonds and deeds and other documents.
- very little violence was more a demonstration of popular feeling of strength and unity.
- Colonial regime passed the Deccan Agriculturist Relief Act of 1879.
- Poona Sarvajanik Sabha led by Justice Ranade organised successful campaign among the peasants and supported the DAR bill.

**Revolt and Analysis**

- The interest on loans were 25-50%
- Introduction of the Ryotwari system led to the disruption of traditional system of tax collection.
- New laws and courts polarised the difference between the Vanis who were village moneylenders and Kunbis or the cultivators.
- Along with the increase in the population, dislocation of the economy, enhancing of rents by the administrators
- Deccan uprising against moneylenders and grain dealers.
- Account papers/bahi khatas, bonds, grains, country cloth, house of moneylenders were burnt.
- Sahukars were both moneylenders and traders

```ad-Views
-   **David Hardiman** : peasants incorporated their uprising into a long tradition of revolt in Maha.
-   **Ravinder Kumar** : cause was redistribution of social power in villages
-   **Ian catanach** : land transfers were not amin reason
-   **Neil Charlesworth** : completely dismisses land transfer as factor only 5 % cultivable land passed to Marwaris
-   **Charlesworth** : inc rates not the reason as Ahmadnagar most affected did not face tax revision
```

- 1867 gov inc rev rates
- Kunbi were peasants
- Poona Sarvajanik Sabha's report : Bombay gov giving major consessions sell movable property then land etc - moneylenders not giving loans insufficient collateral
- Other factors - end of Am civil war, ill conceived tax revision, Kunbis vs sahukars
