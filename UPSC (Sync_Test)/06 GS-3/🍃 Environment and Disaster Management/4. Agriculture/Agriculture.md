## Types of Crops

- **Kharif** - Monsoon Crop from June to Oct/Nov - warm wet weather ex Cotton, Rice, Jowar, Bajara
- **Rabi** from Oct to March - longer length of day ex Wheat, gram, sunflower
- **Zaid** is Summer Crop - warm dry weather, longer weather Ex groundnuts, Watermelon, Pumpkins, Gourds
- **Cereals** are cultivated grasses, **Millets** are types of Cereal grown in less important area where productivity and economics is less
- Pulses are cultivated to enrich the soil and utilise the residual moisture
- Forage crops are where entire vegetative part is used as green fodder
- Jowar, Bajra, Mung are Rain fed crops. Chilli, sugarcane, Banana, Papaya etc are irrigated crops
- Photoperiod is the sunlight time required for plants to flower

### Millets

- Millets are highly variable small seeded grasses aka cereal crops/grains. Can be white, green, yellow, red etc.
- After green revolution production of Millets has drastically gone down.
- Can be grown in harsh conditions due to its high resistance.
- Do not get destroyed easily and provide cheap and high nutrient options Can be consumed even after 10-12 years of growing -> providing food security.
- Has Mg, Vitamin B3 is gluten free and has high protein content.
- Nutritionally superior to wheat and rice.
- FAO has declared to observe International year of Millets in 2023. 2018 was national year of millets in india.
- Ex are Ragi, Bajra, Jowar, Foxtail millet, Kodo millet etc.

## Cropping Patterns

- Cropping pattern depends upon
	- Geographical factors such as Soil, Landforms, precipitation, moisture etc.
	- Socio Cultural factors ex food habits, festivals etc.
	- Infrastructural factors ex irrigation, transport, storage etc.
	- Economic factors like financial resource base, land ownership, size and type of land etc.
	- Technological factors ie improved variety of foods.
- Rainfed agriculture accounts for 92.8 milliion hectare or 65% of cropped area.
- **Ratoon cropping** : raising a crop with regrowth coming out of roots or stocks of harvested crops. Ex Sugarcane, Banana, Sorghum, Pineapple.
- Examples of **Intercropping** Maize + Cowpea , Sorghum/Groundnut + Redgram, Potato/Wheat + Mustard.
- In **mixed cropping** seeds are grown without row arrangement, drylands, seeds are mixed together and then sown, done for subsistence purposes.
- Garden land farming is supplemental irrigation by lifting water from underground sources
- Dryland : entirely dependent on rainfall
- **Mixed farming** : farming with crop production, raising livestock, poultry, fishing, bee keeping.
- Specialised farming : 50% of income of total crop production comes from single crop, where no crop gives 50% total income called general/Diversified farming
- Crop Rotation : Leguminous crop fixes N in soil should be grown before non-leguminous ones
- **Eco farming** : maintenance of soil the way nature would do if left alone, feed the soil not the plant
- **Biodynamic farming** : biologically organic and ecologically sound and sustainable farming
- **Organic farming**: organic manures, nonchemical weed control, biological pest and disease control, mixed farming, crop rotation, organic cycle optimisation
- **Permaculture** : design system for sustainable environment ex houses, technology etc #PrelimsPYQ
- Integrated farming : cropping system, animal husbandry, fisheries etc together
- Macronutrients required by plants are - N,P,K, S, Ca, Mg
    - Nitrogen : constituent of protein, chlorophyll.
    - Phosphorous : enzyme to fix light energy, K for carbon assimilation and transportation of photosynthates, water regulation,
    - Sulphur : part of amino acid builds protein
    - Ca : cell division, growth and enlargement, pollen growth
- Some Micronutrients are : Fe, Zn, Vanadium Va, Ni, Si
- Manures : enriches nutrients, aeration of soil, inc water holding capacity
    - Farm Yard Manure : cattle dung and urine, litter, fodder etc
    - Compost manure - well rotted organic matter
    - Oil cakes mostly rich in N, edible one for cattle and non-edible
    - Bone Meal - bones of animals rich in K
    - Fish meal - NPK
    - Green Manuring - ploughing the green plants to soil, Green Leaf Manuring
    - Biofertilizers - inc micro organisms
- Nitrogen Fixers -

- Watershed Mgt - area of land and water bounded by drainage divide within which surface run off collects and flows through an outlet to a river
- Terracing - reduces the length of hill slide or slope to reduce erosion and formation of gullies
- Physical characteristics of the location where the soil is formed is called Topography
- Components of Soil - clay, gravel, Loam(equal mixture of clay, sand, silt and humus), Sand, silt
- Soil profile - vertical section of soil showing various layers(aka horizons)
- Sodic soils have more Sodium, pH 8.5
    - Acidic soils ph 6.0, H+ and Al3+ predominant
    - pH 8.5 is called alkaline soil, regions with 25 inc rainfall
    - Alfisol - in forest or savanna vegetation.
    - Aridisol - found in desert
- **Podzolisation** - caused due to excessive leaching of Calcium, are acidic
- **Laterisation** - when dried become very hard, process removes silica
- **Gleization** - sticky clay formation below the sub surface layer aka hydroorphic soils
- Solonisation or Alkalisation is the accumulation of Sodium ions

## Stages of Soil Erosion

- Splash erosion - 1st stage, when raindrops hit bare soils
- Sheet erosion - uniform movement of thin layer of soil
- Rill erosion - sheet flows begin to concentrate on land surface, leaving a scouring on the surface
- Gully erosion - it is a scoured area not crossable with tillage or grading equipment <p></p>
- **Allelopathy** - harmful effect of one plant over crops
- **Heaving** - injury to plants caused by lifting upwards of plant along with soil
- **Contour farming** - ploughing across a slope following its elevation contour lines
- **Cover crops** - grown to cover crops to reduce loss of moisture from soil due to leaching
- ** Hard pan** - impermeable layer formed by accumulation of materials, clay etc
- **Sciophytes** - shade loving plants, Heliophytes are sun loving
- **Hidden Hunger** - plants do not exhibit visual symptoms of deficiency
- **Puddling** - ploughing carried out in stagnated water conditions
- **Subsidiary farming** - settled farming in river banks
- System of Rice Intensification SRI - involves changes in nursery mgt, time of transplanting, water and weed management. Synthesis of locally advantageous rice production
