- Cost of Env degradation is about 6% of IN GDP or Rs 3.75 trillion

## Pollution in IHR

- expansion, trekking, tourism etc has caused continued waste dumping
- unplanned growth, non compliance w/ prescribed norms and guidelines

### Various Initiatives Taken to Clean IHR Region :

- HP banned plastic brought laws for disposal of non-biodegradable **garbage**, increased minimum **thickness** of plastic etc
- Nainital Lake has adopted the ==Mission Butterfly program for scientific garbage disposal==.
- ==Lake and Waterways Dev Authority LAWDA== has taken initiative to control pollution **in Dal Lake**
- Assam Hill Land and Ecological Sites #Act, 2006 taken up ==to prevent indiscrminate cutting of hills and filling of water bodies==.

### Recomendations to Combat Pollution

- guidelines to prohibit indiscriminate disposal of garbage
- treatment segregation at point of source, document waste composition
- 4R principle, innovation in treatment, garbage management
- prevent fragmentation of habitat in hill areas, designate areas for dev
- enforce architechtural norms, prevent deforestation, integrated development
- Community based ecotourism as sustainable alternative to commercial tourism ex Himalayan Homestays, Sikkim's Ultimate Tourist Destination policy

## Sand Mining

- process of removal of sand and grave

### Impact of Sand Mining

- causes stripping of sand natural carpet that causes downstream erosion
- prevents sand from acting as aquifers
- revenue loss to exchequer, forces river to change its course
- adversely impacts habitat of micro-organism
- damagest coastal ecosystem

### Suggestions to Combat

- use manufactured sand as alternative : produced from stones used for aggregates
- use fly ash from industries as alternative of sand.
- periodic assessment of sand bed, prudence to lease out mining
- make sand mining to be carried out only by labour

## Palm Oil - Environmental Issues and India's Role in it #important #PrelimsPYQ

- ==33% of vegetable oil made from it==, consumers are India, Indonesia and China
- used for cooking food as a substitute of butter, alo in cosmetics, soaps and detergents as base material

### Environmental Impacts

- to meet production deforestation carried out in countries like Indonesia, Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Sumatra, Congo Basin
- Loss of biodiversity particularly Orangutans
- Climate Change due to deforestation
- use of pesticides and fertilizers esp Paraquat a type of herbicide
- Indian imports from Malaysia, Indonesia.
- AP is the higher producer in IN

### Major Constraints in Domestic Cultivation

- Geographical location not ideal ==best is 8° N and S of Equator==
- Irrigation requires regular rainfall, Long gestation period of 4 yr
- small farm holdings, limited investment by corporate sector

### Gov Plans

- Mo Food give subsidies for distribution of palm oil under PDS
- Oil Palm Dev program now part of Integrated #Scheme of Oilseeds
- Roundtable on Sustainable Oil RSPO estd in 2004 provides certification #body

## Colony Collapse Disorder CCD :

- population of Bees plummeting due to unexplained reason
- Causes could be :
	- Global Warming, parasitic infection, malnutrition, metal pollution, stress, habitat loss
	- ==Neonicotinides are nictoine like insecticides== : water soluble absorbed by pollinators from pollen and nector of treated palnts may be leading to dec
- policy decision to protect bees, reward farmers to protect bees, strengthen bee research, Integrated pest management

## Wildlife Deaths due to Collitions w/ Trains

- Art 51A, 48A
- Coordination b/w MoEFCC and Mo Railways
- demarcate vulnerable patches with signboards,
- Electronic tagging of elephants, leopards etc
- improve infra, posting forest officials in Railway control rooms for better coordination

## Impact of Radiation from Towers

- EMW generated heats up small birds due to low weight and higher surface area, lower body fluid, disturb their ability to navigate, collision leads to deaths
- In humans it causes psychological changes, genetic defects, fatigue, nausea, irritability, headaches

### Responsibilities of Stakeholders

- MoEFCC should notify impact to concerned agencies
- Regular monitoring by state and local bodies, carry out EIA before giving permission
- State Env and Forest dept take awareness measures
- DoT should avoid overlapping of radiation fields, location of towers be geotagged and be made public, refine standards on safe limit of exposure to EMR, precaution to minimise exposure

## Genetically Engineered Trees

- ==1st GE tree in Belgium 1988==, China has inculcated in large scale
- act as carbon sinks ==to help meet Clean Dev Mechanism under Kyoto protocol==
- Difficult to decipher behaviour of new gene in natural env; likely to contaminate vast expanse of native forest threaten ecological balance
- In Indian Rubber research institute dev 1st GET

## Steps Taken to Combat Air Pollution

- improved fuel, comprehensive policy for abetement of pollution
- tightening industrial emission norms, mandatory env clearance for specific industries
- air quality monitoring improved, assessment of pollution load, public awareness
