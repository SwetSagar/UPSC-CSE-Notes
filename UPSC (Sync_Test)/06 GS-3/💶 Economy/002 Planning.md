## Planned Economy

- high level of gov regulation in all major sectors, in distribution of income, decision on quantity and type of produce and its price
- IN decision to go for a planned and mixed economy was moulded by many factors including the 1929 great depression, Rise of USSR and China with dominating role of the state.
- Major factors for deciding Industry as major moving force of economy was Infrastructural needs, Industrial needs, Employment generation, profit development of the social sector, help private sector to rise.

**What is planning?** **How did it start?**

- making of important economic decisions, what and how much is to be produced and whom it is to allocated by a determining authority on the basis of a comprehensive survey.
- In India it was done to fulfil a socio-economic objective.
- It si process of realising well defined goals by optimum utilisation of resources.
- It started first in the USA in 1916 by the Tennesse Valley Authority. Stalin started national planning in USSR in 1928.

## Types of Planning

1. **Imperative Planning**
	- followed by state economies aka directive or target planning ex China and USSR
	- its features are numerical targets of growth and dev, almost no role for market or price mechanism, no private participation in the economy.
	- Market socialism is a part of imperative planning ex Open door policy of China in 1985.
2. **Indicative Planning**
	- seeing the growth in socialist countries some non-socialist ones started indicative planning, most of them were mixed economies.
	- Private sector given substantial role, state only a facilitator and market forces played an important role.
	- numerical targets were set side by side, indicative nature meant that private sector was encouraged or discouraged towards certain areas.
	- free trade from controls, assist Private coys.
	- work on building long term startegic vision for future
	- Ex Monnet plant of France in 1947.
3. There are many other types of planning based on the point of view ex . zi regional or national, centralised or decentralised, long term and short term. **Financial Planning** : physical targets are set against available fin resources, focuses on mobilisaiton and expenditure pattern. **Physical Planning** : output production prioritized.

India has been following normative planning believing that until a prgramme/ scheme run by the govt are not able to connect with customs and traditions of population their acceptability will not be of the desired level.

**Rolling Plan**

- b/w normal plan and plan holiday, are flexible and able to overcome the rigidity of fixed FYPs since there is no fixation of dates in respect of commencement and end of plan.
- revision of yearly target makes it difficult to achieve them
