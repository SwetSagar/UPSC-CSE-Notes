Entrepreneurship + GDP :
-   IN has 3rd largest entrep ecosys in world per WB
-   growth rate from 2014-2018 of new firms has been 12.2%.
-   Growth most in services
-   10% inc in reg of new firms has led to an inc in 1.8% inc in GDDP
-   Entrepreneurship dispersed, dominated by peninsular IN is lacking in NE states
-   Impact of entry of new firms most in mfg sector, can help IN close productivity gaps
-   Entrep in Agri sector not geographically localised spread evenly
-   Highest mfg entrep activity in states w/ flexible labour laws like RAJ, PUN
-   **Transition of labour and resources** from less productive to more productive sectors is required
-   Delhi, Mizoram, UP, Kerala, Andaman and Nicobar have highest activity in Services sector.
 

Determinants of Entrep :
-   Social infra like the education level, no. of colleges etc
-   Physical infra like proximity to large population centre, access to technology and finance.
-   Other : access to local markets, proximity to population centre when goes beyond a point increases hyper competition and decrease new firms

-   Investment in road and connectivity in such a way that it does not discourage new firms through hyper competition
-   EoDB, flexible labour laws especially in mfg sector

Pro-business, creative destruction and wealth creation
-   Sensex did not undergo revisions in listings during the initials years till 1991
-   New firms entered and older ones left post 1991, creative destruction - broadening of sectors listed that was earlier dominated by manufacturing - bridging gap b/w market cap of big and small companies.
 

![Figure 11: Difference between pm-business and pro-crony policy Pro-business •Firms compete on a level playing field •Resource allocation in the economy is efficient •Citizens' welfare is maximized Pro-crony •Some incumbent firms may receive preferential treatment •Resource allocation in the economy may not be efficient •Citizens' welfare may not be maximized ](Pro--Business-vs-Pro-Crony-image1-23303217.png)



-   Politically connected firms give more returns in a pro-crony environment but hamper overall economic growth
    -   26% of roads completed under PMGSY are not mentioned in census suggesting they were never built but money for them was disbursed
    -   Allocation of resources instead of auctioning them - dec in overall growth of coys
-   Wilful defaulters make distresses opaque, make large loans to third parties, wrongly allocate shares leading other borrowers away from market

---


-   ILFS and DHFL defaults - decline in equity prices, dec capacity to raise funds, dec overall credit growth, dec in GDP growth
-   Rollover Risk - frequent refinancing of debt causes higher financing cost
    -   Arises due to mismatch in asset liabilities, liabilities are over dependent on short term wholesale funds viz the LDMF(Liquidity debt Mutual Fund) sector if there is liquidity crunch here rollover to NBFC would be affected
-   Fin resilience is measured by Commercial Paper as % of borrowings, CAR, provisioning policy
-   Operating resilience are by cash as % of borrowings, loan quality and operating expense ratio


| HFCs                                         | Retail NBFCs                 |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Longer duration of assets                    | Hold medium term assets       |
| Less exposed to short term wholesale funding | More exposed                  |
| ALM risk dominates                           | Interconnected risk dominates |
| Fin and Operating resilience are dominating  | same                          |

-    Survey suggest a health score to use as early warning system with metrics like short term volatile capital, asset quality, short term liquidity, provisioning policy, CAR, OPEX ratio
    -   Monitors NBFC, suggest corrective measures, can direct capital infusion, set prudential thresh holds on extent of wholesale funding

-   Performance of CPSEs suggests strategic disinvestment - Gov should discontinue its engagement in producing goods where private sector are prominent
-   Various disinvestment policies are : through minority stake sale, Listing PSEs, Strategic D, Buyback of shares, merger and acquisitions, launch ETFs, Monetisation of select assets of CPSEs
-   Post P CPSEs perform better than their peers in net worth, net profit, RoA, RoE, Gross revenue etc
